</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> first impression that this book may give,
is that I have put the cart before the horse,
and that, instead of dwelling on the Pavement
Masters, I have laid too much stress on the Pavement
itself, and too little on the makers of it. A careful
perusal, however, will, I hope, prove that I have
been right in my reasoning. I have felt strongly,
that in order to form a fair idea of these Masters,
many,—I may say, most,—of whose names are entirely
unknown to the general English reader, it was
necessary to give as clear and vivid a picture as
was possible, of this, their greatest work, through
which their names live. Most people, who have ever
heard of Siena, have heard of its Cathedral Pavement:—an
unique and historical piece of work:—but
how many have heard of even such great
artists as Pietro del Minella and Antonio Federighi?
On this account, it seems to me that the case
needed treatment such as I have given it. I have,
therefore, composed a full and, as far as I could
make it, a clear account of the chain which connects
these men together, and then added short
notices of each, giving all the important facts obtainable
about them. For this purpose, I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
examined all the recognized authorities, and tried
to introduce any side-lights that may brighten up
a somewhat dull record of facts. I have avoided
venturing on criticism: partly because I felt myself
unequal to the task; and partly because my space
was too limited to allow of such digressions without
a sacrifice of more important matter. Where I
have put forward a theoretical suggestion, I have
carefully pointed out that it is only offered as such.
I regret that it is impossible to translate all the
documents quoted, chiefly because the quaint language
in which they are written is untranslatable,
and would lose most of its charm if rendered into
modern English. On the other hand, I have,
where a passage specially important to my argument
occurs in a document, given its general meaning
in the text. I have added a long list of authorities,
and works connected with the Cathedral and
its Pavement which have been consulted, and I
have to thank cordially, for practical and artistic
help, and advice throughout, three ladies: the
Hon. Mrs. A. L. Pelham, Mrs. J. P. Richter, and
Mrs. Trail.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">One</span> might have supposed that when Dante
wrote the lines here quoted, he was describing
the wonderful pavement that still adorns
the Duomo of Siena. But this, we know, cannot be,
since it was not until more than thirty years after
Dante’s death that the plans for a greatly enlarged
Duomo were abandoned, and the Sienese set themselves
to adorn the building in the shape that we
see it now. Moreover, as we shall presently see,
no records of <i>ornamental</i> work done upon the floor
exist earlier than 1369. We may, however, I
think, fairly turn the proposition the other way,
and fancy that the pavement designers had Dante’s
wonderfully descriptive verses in their minds, when
they planned such a work. Their subjects and
his differ vastly; and in the two hundred years
that passed, ere it was in any sense completed,
many variations took place in the original design,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
if complete design there ever was. Still we may
feel, on entering that glorious temple, as if we were
really treading the first parapet of Purgatory, as
pictured by him.</p>

<p>Although the order in which the stories meet
our eyes does not in the least agree with the
chronology of their execution, a sense of fitness
in position seems to run through them, even from
the great West Door itself. Hermes Trismegistus
presenting to his disciples the Poemander, meets
us on the very threshold of the Nave, supported
in either aisle by the majestic figures of the ten
Sibyls; and seems to lead the way, through half-pagan
symbolical designs, to where, surrounded
by the histories of Hebrew heroes and prophets,
the mystery of the Atoning Sacrifice of Christ, the
Very God, the Centre of all Faith and Prophecy
is, before the High Altar itself, symbolized by the
Sacrifice of Isaac.</p>

<p>But this suggestion must not be pressed too far,
because, as I have already remarked, and as the
accompanying plan will show, many variations, for
which at first sight the reason is not very obvious,
have from time to time crept in. For general
purposes, however, the student of the floor may
fairly start with some such complete conception.</p>

<p>From the admirably arranged Archives, both
Ecclesiastical and Communal, of the City of Siena,
we are able to piece together a very nearly complete
history of the work, showing, in most cases,
why certain exceptions probably were made; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
from them, through the medium of the carefully
compiled volumes of the late Signor Gaetano
Milanesi, I have drawn most of the information
which follows.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Vasari’s statement, so often quoted by subsequent
writers, that Duccio made designs for this
pavement, is quite without documentary authority.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
Duccio died more than fifteen years before the
larger Duomo scheme was finally abandoned;
whilst the earliest records dealing with work of
a <i>decorative</i> nature<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> is dated 1369, and runs as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
follows: “<i>a maestro</i> Antonio di Brunaccio <i>vintuna
lire a cinque sol per ij braccia e due quarri di
tarsie di marmo di lo spazzo di Duomo</i>.” In the
following year (1370) we read “<i>a maestro</i> Sano di
Marco <i>per dodici porporelle per lo spazzo di duomo,
a sol: 10 l’una, si danno L. 6.</i>“; “<i>a</i> Francesco di
Ser Antonio <i>per uno braccio e mezzo di compasso
per detto spazzo a ragione d’otto lire e mezzo il
braccio si danno lire 12. e soldi 15</i>,” and “<i>a maestro</i>
Sano di Marco <i>per birichuocoli bianchi e rossi
pello spazzo di duomo, L. 4. soldi 8</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Two years later, according to the historian
Sigismondo Tizio, the Pavement of the nave from
the cupola downwards was begun, and among
other things was laid out (<i>spianata</i>) the design
of the Wheel of Fortune, with figures of men clinging
to it.</p>

<p>And in the next year (1373) an old chronicler<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
tells us that “<i>In questo anno si fece il pavimento a
pietre tassellate</i>,” which no doubt refers to the
circle containing the emblems of Siena, surrounded
by those of the cities friendly and allied to her.
Be it noted here that this is the only portion of
the floor that is <i>tessellated</i>; that is to say, decorated
with designs, made up of small squares of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
different coloured stones, in the manner of ordinary
mosaic.</p>

<p>Then, in 1374, we find reference<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> to work
done, under the direction of Andrea di Minuccio
<i>Operaio</i>, at the foot of the Choir; which was at
that date, and until the commencement of the
sixteenth century, situated under the Cupola.</p>

<p>Again in 1376, 1380, 1398 and 1405, we read
of payments to certain master-workmen, named
Matteo di Bartolo, Nanni di Corsino, Sano di
Matteo, Luca di Ciecho (or Cecco), and Cecco
di Giovanni (or Giovannino di Ciecho), for intarsia
work on the Pavement, apparently in decorative
friezes, some of which, no doubt, exist still,
though we cannot now identify them.</p>

<p>The first authoritative document, however, which
speaks of <i>figures</i> on the Pavement is an entry in
the Duomo Archives, under date March 13th,
1406, which records the payment of 140 lire, “<i>e
quali li debiamo dare</i>,” to Marchesse d’Adamo
(perhaps a son of the architect, Maestro Adamo),
“<i>e compagni maestri di pietra da Como per una
rotta (ruota) anno fatto murare nello spazzo contra
a la sagrestia</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>From the mention of its neighbourhood to the
<i>sacristy</i>, this must point to the circle containing
the figure of Fortitude, No 21, from which, alas!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
restoration, in 1839, has removed all ancient feeling,
and sadly reduced to the commonplace.</p>

<p>After this we find no entries until 1423; but
from that time commences the real history of the
Pavement Masters: and we begin with perhaps
the most interesting personage connected with it;
namely, Domenico di Niccolo del Coro, who held
the post of Capo-maestro<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> of the Opera del Duomo
between the years 1413 and 1423. It is not easy
now to separate the work attributed to Domenico
from that of another artist, Paolo di Martino, who
appears to have immediately succeeded Domenico
as Capo-maestro. We know, however, that the
following portions of the floor were executed at
that date:</p>

<p>1. David the Psalmist, surrounded by four
Musicians (No. 53).<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>2. David the Youth with his Sling (No. 55).</p>

<p>3. The Giant Goliath falling backwards
(No. 54).</p>

<p>4. Moses (No. 16).</p>

<p>5. Samson chastising the Philistines (No. 14).</p>

<p>6. Judas Maccabeus (No. 15).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
7. Joshua (No. 23).</p>

<p>8. The Slaughter of the Five Kings of the
Amorites (No. 22).</p>

<p>Of these eight subjects the first three may be
with certainty given to Domenico himself; whilst
Nos. 5 and 8 may be<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> ascribed to the other artist.
Of the single figures that of Judas Maccabeus is so
entirely concealed now by the balustrade of the
altar of the Blessed Sacrament built over it, that
it is impossible to ascertain with any degree of
absolute certainty who was its author; but Joshua
and Moses are given by Milanesi to Paolo di
Martino.</p>

<p>Domenico seems to have been a great and
versatile artist, a worker in glass,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> as well as in
marble, and above all famous for his skill in woodcarving
and inlay. The restorations of his work
here, which have evidently been frequent, have
robbed it of very much of the charm, which we
feel so strongly in his inlaid panels in the Palazzo
Pubblico Chapel, but there is still a naïve originality
about the designs, which cannot fail to show
his high merit.</p>

<p>The next celebrated artist, who left his mark on
this floor was the painter, Domenico di Bartolo di
Ghezzo of Asciano, whose charming design of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Emperor Sigismund enthroned, No. 13, is one of
the most marked exceptions to the general scheme.</p>

<p>Next we have Pietro del Minella, the celebrated
sculptor, and a pupil of the still more famous
Giacomo della Quercia. He also left only one
design, but that perhaps the most striking in the
entire floor: Absalom hanging by his hair, No. 12.</p>

<p>Then appears that great craftsman, Antonio
Federighi, whose graceful “Ages of Man,” No. 6,
would alone entitle him to take a high rank in the
History of Art. The works of Art left by this
artist here and elsewhere are many, and of a very
varied description; but we must now pass on to
perhaps the most interesting and prolific period in
the History of the Duomo, during which the floor
was by no means left uncared for.</p>

<p>The City of Siena outside was a prey to constant
faction and civil disturbance, but her Duomo within,
under the fostering care and taste of the noble
Alberto Aringhieri, Knight of Rhodes and Malta,
Rettore from 1481–1498, was steadily growing in
beauty and splendour. I cannot here enumerate
all the embellishments added during this period to
the fabric, though among them I may name the
decoration of the interior of the Cupola: the adornment
of the Chapel of S. Giovanni, where may
still be seen Pinturicchio’s beautiful portraits of
Aringhieri himself in youth and age: and the
frieze of Papal busts that runs round the entire
building.</p>

<p>Aringhieri collected around him a band of artists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
eminent already as painters and sculptors; among
whom was Federighi himself. From the designs
and with the skill of these, he completed the floor
of the North and South Transepts; both the Aisles
and the last bay of the Nave. Whether, as is
possible, he was influenced in his choice of subjects
by external historical events, we cannot now
say; but some at least of the designs, while appropriate
to the general idea of the whole, appear to
have a possible political significance. Thus the
“Massacre of the Innocents,” No. 26, designed by
Matteo di Giovanni Bartoli, may have been chosen
to commemorate the terrifying episodes that occurred
during the Sack of Otranto by the Turks;
and the Expulsion of Herod, No. 27, the Fall of
Pandolfo Petrucci and his faction. Whether this
was so or not, the works of this period are among
the finest and noblest designs on the entire floor.
The later work of Beccafumi may be more realistic,
but nothing can surpass the force and feeling
of power exhibited in the fourteen designs, which
date their origin from this period.</p>

<p>In 1505–6 was added Pinturicchio’s “Allegory of
Fortune,” No. 36; and shortly after an important
change in the interior arrangement of the building,
by exposing a great deal of floor space, necessitated
the addition of a large number of fresh designs,
which Domenico Beccafumi (<i>il Mecarino</i>) called
upon to supply. This change was the removal,
under the direction of Baldassare Peruzzi, Capo-maestro
in 1532, of the High Altar, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
hitherto stood under the Cupola, to their present
position, further east in the Apse.</p>

<p>Beccafumi had previously, in 1525 and 1531, designed
his scenes from the Life of Moses, Nos. 51
and 52, and he now, in 1544–46, was commissioned
to make designs to surround the Altar-steps. Of
the history of the Elijah designs, Nos. 41–46, under
the Cupola, attributed to him, I wish to speak at
greater length, so I will reserve the details concerning
them until the next chapter.</p>

<p>In 1661 the building of the Cappella del Voto
by Pope Alexander VII. destroyed the ancient
Porta del Perdono; and the scene representing
the Consecration of the Cathedral, designed by
Guasparre d’Agostino, and executed by Corso di
Bastiano in 1451, which formerly lay before that
door, was ruthlessly destroyed.</p>

<p>In 1750, certain Virtues, Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, were
designed by Carlo Amidei for the entrance to the
above-mentioned chapel. This artist also restored
a good many of the older designs, and added, it
is generally assumed, four lozenges to the story of
Elijah, Nos. 47–50, under the Cupola. These were
all considered worthless and removed in 1875 to
make way for new designs by Sig. Prof. Alessandro
Franchi, the present Director of the Accademia
delle Belle Arti. This accomplished gentleman also
designed three hexagons to complete the Story
of Elijah, Nos. 38, 39 and 40, and to fill spaces,
up to that time occupied by fragments of older
work, brought from other parts of the Cathedral.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
These designs were all executed under his direction
by Signor Leopoldo Maccari in 1878.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Between the years 1864 and 1878 a complete
restoration of the whole floor has taken place.
Much time and money have been expended upon
the work, and the result is, on the whole, not unsatisfactory;
but the effects of previous restorations
by less sympathetic hands in certain parts is
painfully apparent. Some of the work, beautiful
still, but too much injured to remain <i>in situ</i> has
been removed to the Museum of the Opera del
Duomo, and replaced by copies.</p>

<p>This Pavement, in spite of the opinions of those
who consider pictorial design unsuitable floor decoration,
is a never-ending source of joy and
pleasing suggestion: an unique <i>tour de force</i>, and
a stroke of genius on the part of the original designers.
Except during the month of August, the
entire centre portion from the West door to the
High Altar itself is carefully protected by boarding.
When this is removed, and the whole vista is
spread out before one, it would be hard to imagine
any other species of floor, that would have so
satisfactorily completed the many-coloured interior
harmonies of this wonderful Cathedral.</p>

<h3>1. THE PLATFORM BEFORE THE WESTERN FAÇADE.</h3>

<p>Tizio<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> tells us that this platform with its three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15<a class="hidep" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
steps was laid down in 1448, under the direction
of Giovanni Borghesi, then Rettore of the Opera.
Originally there were apparently five designs upon
it, of which, however, only four were still distinguishable
when, in the seventeenth century, Landi
wrote his elaborate description of the floor.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> These
were: In the centre, as at present, the Pharisee
and the Publican kneeling before a round Temple:
On either side a vase; the one inscribed <i>Mel</i>
(Honey), the other <i>Fel</i> (Gall), symbolic perhaps
of the imperfection of earthly joys. On the right-hand
side on entering was the Sacrifice of Abel;
and on the other side, Landi says, that there was
no pictured design, but merely a fancy pattern of
coloured marbles, probably replacing a scene previously
destroyed by time and hard usage. The
constant stream of traffic across this Platform has
necessitated frequent restoration of the Pavement;
and the story of Abel has now entirely vanished.
The vase, also, on the right, now bears the label
<i>Lac</i> (Milk), instead of <i>Fel</i>, perhaps in allusion to
the Promised Land, and the Golden Jerusalem of
Bernard of Clairvaux’s hymn. This work is executed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
in the earliest of the four principal methods
of design: namely <i>a trapano</i>; that is to say, outlined
on a slab of white marble in little dots made
with a trepanning drill.</p>

<p>The figures of the Pharisee and the Publican
are executed with great spirit, but are entirely
modern in feeling and conception.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Each figure
is formed of a slab or slabs of white marble, cut in
outline, and let into a background, of which the
atmosphere is black and the ground red marble, so
that each figure stands out clear and distinct.
Lines of feature, folds of robes and other accessories
are outlined, as described above, with a
trepanning drill. Certain pieces of yellow marble
have been added at the sides of the picture, which
seem unnecessary and even discordant. They
may have been placed there during the restorations
which took place here but a few years since.</p>

<h3>2. THE SPACES IN THE THREE DOORWAYS OF THE
WESTERN FAÇADE.</h3>

<p>The three much-worn scenes that remain here
evidently represent the “Ceremonies of Ordination”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
in the three degrees; and such is the opinion of
Faluschi, Landi, and Della Valle. Padre Everardo
Micheli, however, wishes us to believe that these
scenes illustrate the “Reconciliation of the Penitent:”
a proposition which seems to me both far-fetched
and improbable.</p>

<p>These works, executed in the same methods and
with the same materials as those just described,
retain far more of their original feeling and sentiment;
and it is interesting to compare them with
a similar set in the doorways of San Giovanni (the
Baptistery), which represent the “Birth,” “Baptism,”
and “Anointing of an Infant Christian.”</p>

<p>In the first case we have, to the extreme right,
the “Ordination of the Deacon;” next, that “of the
Priest;” and, finally, that “of the Bishop.” In the
other, to the extreme left, is the “Birth of the Child”
(a composition curiously similar to that employed
by many painters at this period for the Birth of St.
John the Baptist): then “Its Baptism;” and lastly,
“Its Anointing and Reception into the Church of
Christ.” Of these three scenes, commenced in
1450 by a certain Bartolomeo di Mariano, called
<i>Il Mandriano</i>, from designs made by one Nastagio
di Guasparre; that in the centre, which we read
was executed by Antonio Federighi (1451),<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> is
very much the finest, although there is a certain
similarity in general conception throughout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
On further research, we find that a certain
Guasparre, described as “<i>dipentore nostro</i>,” made
a design for the space before the door for the then
existing Porta del Perdono.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> This design represented
the “Consecration of the Duomo” in 1174,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
and was executed by Corso di Bastiano of Florence.</p>

<p>Now Guasparre d’Agostino, also designated as
“<i>nostro dipentore</i>,“<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> about this same time painted
certain scenes from the Life of S. Bernardino for
the Sacristy of the Duomo, and also decorated the
apse of the Baptistery with frescoes of the “Crucifixion
and Burial of Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> We may not unreasonably
suppose that the above-mentioned
Nastagio was his son or pupil, and that the father
and son, or master and pupil, were associated
together in all these similar works around the
doors of the Cathedral and Baptistery. Unfortunately
the work known to have been designed
by Guasparre before the Porta del Perdono was,
together with that entrance itself, ruthlessly destroyed
in 1661, so that we have nothing certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
remaining of his Pavement work upon which to
start comparison. The force and charm, however,
of the compositions, still existing before the Western
Doorway of the Cathedral; show that they must
have been executed from the designs of no mean
or inferior draughtsman.</p>

<p>We find also several references at this date,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> to
work done outside the Duomo by Bastiano di
Corso, a Florentine, fine work by whom, as we
shall see presently, still exists inside also; but it
is not easy to identify the exact portion laid down
by him and his son Corso, who, as we have seen
above, was employed on the work before the Porta
del Perdono.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice how sharp and clear is
the trepanning work in the older of these designs,
and how close together the points have been
drilled. It would appear as if, contrary to the
method employed in the more modern work, no
graving tool had been used, nor any stucco to fill
up the holes and outlines.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>And now we enter the Church.</p>

<h3>3. THE NAVE.</h3>

<p>The first thing that meets the eye is an inscription:</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">“CASTISSIMUM VIRGINIS TEMPLUM CASTE MEMENTO
INGREDI.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p class="in0">It is unknown by whom, or when, this inscription
was laid down, but it is possible that it was introduced
at the same time as the design which
follows it.</p>

<div id="ip_21" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 44em;">

<p class="floatl">ALINARI PHOTO.]</p>
<p class="floatr">[DESIGNED BY GIOVANNI<br />DI MAESTRO STEFANO (?)</p>
<p class="floatc">III. HERMES TRISMEGISTUS (No. 33)</p></div></div>

<p>Beyond this appears the commanding figure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
a man in a high crowned head-dress, apparently
an Eastern Sage, holding out with his right hand,
to two other men, a book inscribed <span class="smcap smaller">SUSCIPITE O
LICTERAS ET LEGES EGYPTII</span>; while with his left, he
points to a quotation on a slab supported by two
winged sphinxes. The principal figure represents
the semi-mythical Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus,
who, as we read below, was “Contemporaneus
Moysi.” The two men, one old and turbaned, and
the other veiled, may perhaps typify the learned
men of the East and West. (Ill. III.)</p>

<p>The introduction of this mysterious personage,
whose very existence is extremely doubtful, is most
interesting to the student of Renaissance philosophical
and theological ideas. Since to his fabled
authorship are attributed a vast number of works
dealing with ancient wisdom and religious belief,
as well as many treatises on ecclesiastical ceremonial,
the placing of him on the threshold of this
magnificent Temple is not without appropriate
suggestion. From the principal work attributed
to him “the Poemander”,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> is drawn the quotation
inscribed on the slab beside him here; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
enthusiastic attitudes of the two Seekers after
Knowledge before him are very forcibly expressed.</p>

<p>This admirable design was placed here in 1488,
under the Rectorship of Alberto Aringhieri, mentioned
in the last chapter. He, being a Knight of
St. John of Jerusalem and of Rhodes, must have
been familiar with the mystical tastes and theories
of those who endeavoured to bring the learning,
lore, and art of Pagan ideals into line with Christian
Dogma and Faith. Hence the choice under his
direction of this subject, and, as we shall presently
see, of the ten Sibyls also.</p>

<p>It is not definitely known who designed this
group; but it is generally supposed, with considerable
show of reason, to have been Giovanni di
Maestro Stefano:<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and it appears to have been
the last of the series commissioned by Aringhieri,
as Rettore, since his occupation of that post ended
in 1498.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> He seems, though, seven years later,
to have commissioned Pinturicchio’s “Allegory of
Fortune.”</p>

<p>The next design is that of the Badges or
Emblems of Siena, surrounded by those of her
allies. In the middle is the Wolf of Siena suckling
the Twins. In a circle round her are the
symbols of the following cities; Florence (a Lion,
the “<i>Marzocco</i>”); Lucca (a Lynx); Pisa (a Hare);
Viterbo (an Unicorn); Perugia (a Stork); Rome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
(an Elephant bearing a Tower); Orvieto (a
Goose); and Arezzo (a Horse). In the four
corners of the surrounding square are, Massa (a
smaller Lion); Grosseto (a Goat); Volterra (a
Vulture); and Pistoia (a Dragon). (Ill. IV.)</p>

<p class="smaller">(The only panel in mosaic)</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
This, the only portion of the Pavement that is
really executed in mosaic, was, as we have seen
already, laid down in 1373; but we are unable to
trace the author. Fragments of the original work
are still existing in the Museum of the Opera;
but the whole design has been replaced by a
modern copy, carefully made by Sig. Maccari in
1865.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Beyond this is a large geometrical pattern. A
wheel with twenty-four columnar spokes, in the
centre of which appears the Imperial Eagle. Of
this design little or nothing is known; but the author
of <i>La Guida Artistica</i> supposes it to have been of
the same date as that last described (1373). It is
possible that, before the days of Alberto Aringhieri,
the whole of the Nave floor, except “Fortune’s
Wheel,” in the first bay, may have been covered
with geometrical or heraldic devices only, as can
be seen at Lucca, and that all of them, except
these last two, were removed to make way for
other more interesting subjects.</p>

<p>The next scene is Pinturicchio’s well-known
design, called in the old documents “La Storia
della Fortuna.” It might just as well though be
designated as “the Reward of Virtue,” or the
“Pursuit of Wisdom.” (Ill. V.)</p>

<p>Wisdom, a sedate woman, royally robed, veiled,
and crowned with a jewelled wreath, is throned
upon the upper platform of a small precipitous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
rock in the midst of the sea. The platform is
covered with growing flowers, as is also the winding
path which leads to it. On Wisdom’s right
hand stands Socrates, holding a book, to whom
she offers a branch of palm. On her left is Crates,
who is hastily emptying into the sea a basketful
of rings, chains, and other jewels. To him she
extends a closed volume. Over the head of
Wisdom, on a tablet, appears the following inscription:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">HUC PROPERATE VIRI, SALEBROSUM SCANDITE MONTEM<br /></span>
<span class="i2">PULCHRA LABORIS ERUNT PREMIA PALMA QUIES.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the path below, which, besides flowers, is
strewn with stones and over-run with reptiles and
small animals, is a crowd of ten men, seekers after
Wisdom, who apparently have just been landed
upon the Island by Fortune. The attitudes of
these men, some of whom at least appear to be
portraits, are very striking. Alone at the head of
the procession strides a stately personage—a
patron perhaps of art and learning. Next to him
an old man, leaning on a crutch-handled staff,
plods determinedly along. Following him, a
younger man looks back and shakes his fist at
Fortune. Behind him stand six figures with
varied expressions of interest or desire. In front
of them an elderly man with a beard has sunk
down exhausted, his book clasped in his left arm,
too weary to move on. On the extreme right of
the picture stands Fortune, a nude woman with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27<a class="hidep" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
cornucopia in her right hand. She is the most
striking figure in the composition. Her left foot
is resting on a globe, perhaps to indicate her
instability, while with her right she seems to push
off the boat, shattered and broken-masted, in
which these travellers have journeyed to the
island. Above her head she holds a sail, which
the wind has filled out, one end of which, wound
round her body, is grasped also by her right hand.
Obviously this design is one of those conceits so
dear to the Renaissance mind. Fortune has,
with favouring breeze, but through stormy waters,
brought the seekers after Knowledge to the Mount
of Wisdom; and the artist has endeavoured in
these ten figures to symbolize the varied character
of her votaries. Socrates stands calmly waiting
for his reward; Crates earns his by contempt of
all things worldly.</p>

in 1506.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
The last design in the Nave is perhaps the
oldest of all; but the actual piece of Pavement
that we now see is a complete renovation by
Signor Maccari in December, 1864, costing
2,491 lire 98 c. Tizio<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> tells us that it was executed
in 1372, and though he does not say who was the
author of the design, or who executed the work,
we know that Andrea di Minuccio was Operaio
at this time,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and that under his direction, two
years later, the work at “<i>the foot of the Choir</i>” was
completed.</p>

<p>We see a wheel with eight columnar spokes.
To give an effect of rotatory motion, the border is
inlaid in small lozenges of black and white marble,
arranged to represent cogs. At the top of the
wheel sits a King, enthroned and crowned, with
orb and sceptre. Clinging to the two sides and
bottom are three figures of men, whose anxiety
to retain their hold, as the wheel revolves, is
forcibly expressed. The wheel is surrounded by
a continuous band of black and white marble,
which, looped octagonally at the angles, incloses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
in the spaces so formed, half lengths of the following
four Sages: Epictetus, Aristotle, Seneca and
Euripides. Each Sage holds a scroll, with a
quotation from one of his own writings. (Ill. VI.)</p>

<p class="floatc">VI. THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE (No. 37)</p></div></div>

<p>This design may be compared with another
Wheel of Fortune, inlaid by Domenico del Coro
in the lower panel of a door in the Chapel of the
Palazzo Comunale. Padre Micheli calls it the
Wheel of Ambition,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> although the wheel itself is
inscribed “<i>Rota della Fortuna</i>.” He thus describes
it: “To the lower part is a man clinging,
beside whom is written the inscription ‘<i>So senza
Regno</i>’ (I am without a Kingdom). Half way
up the wheel, to his right, clings another figure of
a man, this time with the head of an ass, and the
inscription ‘<i>Regnero</i>’ (I will reign). On the top of
the wheel is seated an ass, with the word ‘<i>Regno</i>’
(I reign); and lastly, on the other side, going
downwards, is an ass with a man’s head, and the
motto ‘<i>Regnai</i>’ (I have reigned).” The author
of this inlaid panel, who must in his former position
of Capo-maestro, have known well the larger
and older design, probably wished to improve
upon it; but it is somewhat remarkable to find it
placed among panels symbolising the Articles of
Christian Faith.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Let us now turn to</p>

<h3>4. THE SOUTH AISLE.</h3>

<p>Both this and the North Aisle are adorned with
representations of the ten Sibyls, five in each.
These Sibyls were all placed here under the Rectorship
of Alberto Aringhieri in the years 1482–83.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
The introduction of these mythical personages
into ecclesiastical art was not unusual at this
period, and they take their place beside the
Prophets, as forerunners of Christ.</p>

<p>They form a curious link between the Pagan
and Christian world of thought. According to
Greek ideas, Sibyls were women under the inspiration
of the Deity, but they are not spoken of
at all by either Homer or Herodotus: and the first
Greek writer who mentions them is Heraclitus
(<i>circa</i> 500 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>). Aristophanes, Plato and other
early writers only mention <i>one</i>: <a id="Heraclides_Ponticus"></a>Heraclides Ponticus,
a pupil of Plato, speaks of <i>three</i> (the
Erythraean, Phrygian, and Hellespontine); but
Pausanias gives <i>four</i> (the Libyan, Erythraean,
Cuman, and Hebrew). Of these the oldest was
said to have been the Libyan: though the best
known to modern times are undoubtedly the
Delphic, the Cuman (visited by Æneas), and the
Tiburtine, who is said to have foretold Christ to
the Emperor Augustus.</p>

<p>By Christian writers they are spoken of first
in the second century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, but do not appear in
art until the eleventh. In the handbook of Mount
Athos we read of the “<i>Wise</i> Sibyl”; and side
by side with David, one of these prophetesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
appears in the Sequence of Thomas of Celano:
the Dies Irae (<i>circa</i> 1253).<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> They have no place
in early mosaics, but one of the most ancient
representations of a Sibyl is that of the Tiburtine
in the church of Sta. Maria Aracoeli in Rome.</p>

<p>The first, and perhaps the most poetic Choir of
them, is on the pulpit of S. Andrea at Pistoia,
sculptured by Giovanni Pisano in 1301; but from
that time, until the fifteenth century, we find no
other <i>groups</i> of them. Then appeared a great
many representations, and their number increases
rapidly to as many as thirteen, the last of whom
is the Queen of Sheba, who is called Nichaula,
and is fabled to have foretold to King Solomon
the Advent of a Messiah. The usual numbers,
however, are <i>three</i>, <i>four</i>, <i>six</i> and <i>ten</i>; and in such
groups they have been designed by the greatest
artists. Giotto,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Perugino,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Pinturicchio,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Raphael,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
and Michael Angelo,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> are but a few of these.
Not only throughout Italy, but to the Northern
Art Schools of Germany and Flanders, the same
cult spread; and we find them introduced into
sculpture, painting and engraving. Sibyls assist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
as interested and sympathizing spectators, in every
scene of Holy Writ. They meet us even in painted
windows and illustrated books of devotion.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> It is
therefore not remarkable to find them here; and,
if one recognizes the attitude of mind, with which
they were regarded by the Renaissance Catholic,
they are even most appropriate. The number
chosen is in accordance with that fixed by Varro,
and with the exception of the <i>Cumaean</i>, who seems
to take the place of the <i>Cimmerian</i> in his list, the
choice of prophetesses is the same.</p>

<p>For the purpose of study, let us begin at the
Western door; and commence with</p>

<h4><i>The Delphic Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>Delphi, famous in ancient times for its Oracles,
would not unnaturally suggest itself to these early
students of Greek art and literature as one of the
places whence prophecies of the Redemption of
the World should come. Hence Plutarch calls
her the <i>first</i> of the Sibyls. According to Pausanias,
the Erythraean Sibyl, although a native of
Marpessus, or Erythrae, in the Troad, lived mostly
at Samos, and visited Clarus, Delos, and Delphi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
at all of which places were shrines dedicated to
the Pythian Apollo, whose special gift this form of
prophetic utterance was said to be. Later tradition
would seem to have divided her attributes into at
least three, and given them separate existence.
Here she is shown as a stately woman, bearing in
her left hand a decorated horn from which issue
flames. Her right hand rests on a tablet supported
by a winged sphinx, which bears the words:</p>

<div class="p1 center"><div class="ilb">
<p class="in0 vspace">IPSVM TVVM CO<br />
GNOSCE DEVM<br />
QVI DEI FILIVS EST<br />
</p>
</div></div>

<p class="center b1">(Know thy God Himself, Who is the Son of God.)</p>

<p class="in0">Beneath her feet a label records her name, and
the fact that she is mentioned by Chrysippus in
his Book of Divination. We find<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> that this figure
was executed in 1482 by Giuliano di Biagio and
Vito di Marco, who probably also made the design
for the work, as the payment they received was
579 lire 10 soldi. We may compare this amount
with the sum paid in 1866–69 for the restoration
of the same Sibyl. It was 2,341 lire 17 c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<h4><i>The Cumaean Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>It is not clear why this Sibyl is so named, especially
as it provokes confusion with the more
celebrated “Sibilla <i>Cumana</i>.” Apparently the
Cimmerian Sibyl is intended. Ferdinand Piper
tells us that she was sometimes styled the Italian
Sibyl,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and mentions other variations of the name:
“Cymea, Chymerea or Chimica.” According to
the label, supported behind her by two charming
<i>putti</i>, she is said to have been mentioned by Piso
in his Annals. Here she is represented as an
excited-looking woman, with loose hair scattered
over her shoulders. She bears in her hand a
tablet, with the following words inscribed upon it:</p>

<div class="p1 center"><div class="ilb">
<p class="in0 vspace">
ET MORTIS FATVM FINI<br />
ET, TRIVM DIERVM SO<br />
MNO SUSCEPTO TUNC<br />

INITIVM OSTENDENS.
</p>
</div></div>

<p class="in0 b1">(He shall accomplish the fate of death, having
undergone a sleep of three days. Then being
returned from the dead, he shall come into the
light, showing the first beginning of the resurrection).</p>

<p>This design is said to be the work of Luigi di<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Ruggiero, called <i>l’Armellino</i>, and Vito di Marco;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
but, except a notice dated 1482<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> of payments to
the first-named worker for marble cut by him for
work on “<i>li spazi di Duomo e per le Sibille</i>,” we
have no further record as to the author of this
particular design, or its cost. We find, however,
that in the restoration above referred to, it cost
2,581 lire 80 c.</p>

<h4><i>The Cuman Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>This Sibyl is famed in poetic story as having
been visited by Æneas: an interview described
with much graphic minuteness by Virgil, in Book
VI. of the Æneid. Endless legends have accumulated
in connection with her, and her presence
is associated with many spots in and around
Naples. Ferdinand Piper states that the names
of Amalthea, Demophile, and Herophile have
been given to her by different writers,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and that
Justin Martyr asserts that she was daughter of
Berosus, and came from Babylon to Campania.
She is said to have lived for a thousand years;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
and to have been the ancient prophetess, who
offered the Sibylline Books to Tarquin. These
books, the oldest collection of which was, according
to tradition, made about the time of Solon
and Cyrus, by the Sibyl of Marpessus (the Erythraean
Sibyl), at Gergis, on Mount Ida, found
their way thence to Erythrae; from there to Cumae;
and so to Rome. In 83 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> they were burned;
but fragments of their contents continued to exist
orally until <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 12, when they were collected and
revised by the Emperor Augustus, and were surviving
in 363. In the year 400 they were again
destroyed by Stilicho; and the present so-called
Sibylline books are a spurious invention of Jewish
and Christian writers.</p>

<p>Here she appears as a somewhat severe old
woman, with a veil wound round her head. In her
right hand she carries the mistletoe bough of the
Virgilian story; and with her left she clasps to her
three books. Piled on the ground to her right, and
burning, are six more, representing those destroyed
by her in the Tarquinian legend; and above her
left shoulder two flying cherubs bear a tablet, with
the following inscription:</p>

<div class="p1 center"><div class="ilb">
<p class="in0 vspace">
VLTIMA CVMAEI VENIT IAM<br />
CARMINIS AETAS MAGNUS<br />
ABINTEGRO SAECLORVM<br />

SATVRNIA REGNA, IAM<br />

</p>
</div></div>

<span class="i0">(Now has come the last period of Cumaean song,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now a new progeny is sent down from lofty Heaven.)</span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="p1 in0">Her label bears the words “Sibilla Cumana meminit
Virgilius. Eclog. IV.”</p>

<p>This figure is the work of Giovanni di Maestro
Stefano di Giovanni and his scholars, and was
executed by him in 1482.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> He received for it the
sum of 697 lire, 9 soldi and 2 c. It was restored at
the same time as the other Sibyls, in 1866–69, at
a cost of 2,743 lire 6 c.</p>

<h4><i>The Erythraean Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>This Sibyl, as we have already seen, is one of
those named in the earliest lists by Pausanias.
She is said to have been a native of Marpessus or
Erythrae in the Troad, and he, as well as some
other writers, gives her the name of Herophile;
one authority however speaks of a <i>Trojan</i> Sibyl,
whom he calls Herophila, and names the Erythraean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
one, Symmachia. She lived, as we have said before
when writing of the Delphic Sibyl, chiefly at
Samos, but visited Clarus, Delos and Delphi. This
would, no doubt, account for the difficulty in distinguishing
the various place-names attached to
these different women. As we have also seen above,
the Sibylline books are said to have been once
preserved at Erythrae, and Lactantius attributes
to her the famous acrostic which announces the
Coming of the Anointed One, Son of God Himself,
as Saviour of the World. Here she is depicted
as a tall patrician lady, with a rather forbidding
countenance, and a very curious head-dress, which
partially envelops her face. Her right hand
clasps a closed volume, while the left rests on an
open book, supported by a carved lectern. On
the pages of this book are written the following
words:</p>

<table class="twoup p1 narrow" summary="Inscription on Erythraean Sibyl">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">DE EXCELSO</td>
    <td class="tdl">ET NASCETVR</td></tr>

    <td class="tdl">IN DIEBVS NO</td></tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="tdl"><span class="in2">SVOS</span></td>
    <td class="tdl"><span class="in1">TERRAE</span></td></tr>
</table>

<p class="b1">(From the High Habitation of Heaven God has
looked down on His humble (servants), and shall
be born in these most recent days of a Hebrew
Virgin in the cradle of the earth.)</p>

<p>Beside her on a stool is a tablet, telling us that
this is the Erythraean Sibyl, whom Apollodorus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
claimed as his fellow citizen. This Sibyl was
designed and executed by Antonio Federighi in
1482; and we are told that he received 649 lire
17 soldi for it.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> It is interesting to note that this
and the Samian are the only Sibyls signed by their
designers. Federighi’s evident taste for faithful
representation of the costumes of his period, apparent
also in his other works, would account for
the rather bizarre head-dress above referred to.
The cost of restoration of this Sibyl was 2,043 lire
13 c.</p>

<h4><i>The Persian Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>Ferdinand Piper, quoting a scholiast on Plato,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
identifies this Sibyl with the one elsewhere variously
called Chaldaean, Babylonian, Egyptian and Hebrew.
He tells us further, that tradition called
her also the daughter of Berosus, and daughter-in-law
of Noah, which raises confusion with the
Cuman.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> He adds, also, that sometimes the name
of Sabbe is given to her, and sometimes that of
Sambetha. Nothing more is known of this Sibyl;
but it is worth noting that the prophecy here attributed
to her is the only one that does not deal
with the Birth or Atonement of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
She is represented as a pleasant-looking woman
of middle age, with her head bound up in a simple
veil. In her left hand she carries a book, and
with her right she draws attention to a tablet,
resting on a carved pedestal, with an inscription
as follows:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza vspace">
<span class="i0">PANIBVS SOLVM QVINQVE<br /></span>
<span class="i2">ET PISCIBVS DVOBVS HO<br /></span>

<span class="i2">COPHINOS IMPLEBIT<br /></span>
<span class="i0">IN SPEM MVLTORVM.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="b1">(With five loaves and two fishes He will satisfy
the hunger of five thousand men on the grass.
Taking up the remains, he will fill twelve baskets,
for the hope of many.)</p>

<p>Beneath her feet, a label informs us that it is
Nicanor who bears record of her. Urbano di
Pietro da Cortona, Antonio Federighi, Vito da
Marco and Luigi Ruggiero (<i>l’Armellino</i>) received
commissions to execute these Sibyls on September
20th, 1481;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> but Urbano does not appear to have
received his payment of 605 lire 12 soldi for the
execution of this one, until October, 1483.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The
sum paid to restore his work was 3,153 lire 84 c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<h3>5. <span class="smcap">The North Aisle.</span></h3>

<h4><i>The Albunean Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>This prophetess, as we gather from the label
placed beneath her feet, was also styled the <i>Tiburtine</i>
Sibyl, because she was “<i>honoured as Divine
at Tibur</i>.” From a Christian point of view she is
perhaps the best known of all the Sibyls, and the
representations of her in art, still extant, are
many and very varied in conception.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> The Emperor
Augustus is said to have visited her, and,
as a result of her prophecy, erected the altar inscribed
“<span class="smcap smaller">ARA PRIMOGENITI DEI</span>,” now inclosed in
the Cappella Santa (or di S. Elena) of the Church
of Sta. Maria Aracoeli in Rome.</p>

<p>She is here represented as a tall and youngish
woman, with a curious pointed head-dress. In her
right hand she carries an open book; while above
her left shoulder, and attached by a ribbon to the
neck of a small cherub, is a tablet on which are
the words:</p>

<div class="p1 center"><div class="ilb">

Bull) being in the ascendant, the founder of peace.
Oh Happy Mother whose breast shall give him
milk.)</p>

<p>This Sibyl was designed by Benvenuto di Giovanni
del Guasta in 1483,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and is a fine specimen
of his work; but it is not known definitely who
executed this, or indeed any of the four remaining
Sibyls. We read, however, that Giuliano di Biagio
was in this year paid 41 lire 15 soldi for the carriage
of 9,310 lbs. of marble for this work,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> so presumably
he and his assistants executed some if
not all of them. 2,149 lire 35 c. were paid for the
restoration of this Sibyl in 1866–69.</p>

<h4><i>The Samian Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>Of this Sibyl we know nothing, and can only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45<a class="hidep" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
point out, as in the case of the Delphic and Erythraean
Sibyls, that the latter of those prophetesses,
though born in the Troad, made her principal
abode at Samos: and that thus these three may
have been one and the same person. We are told,
by the label beneath her representation, that she is
spoken of by Eratosthenes, a writer quoted by
Lactantius, and whose work was one of the first
books printed in Italy in 1465.</p>

<p>This figure is one of the most beautiful of all
the ten Sibyls, and well it may be, seeing that it
was designed by that delightful draughtsman and
earnest artist, Matteo di Giovanni Bartoli. A
slender princess, with flowing draperies, she supports
with her left hand a handsomely-bound open
volume. A curious and characteristic feature of
Matteo’s work is evident in the charming cherub-head,
with outspread wings, that clasps a girdle
round her robe below the hips. Beside her on a
tablet, upborne by two lion-headed figures, is the
following inscription:</p>

<p>At the foot of the tablet is the designer’s signature,
with the date 1483. (Ill. VII.)</p>

<p>Matteo di Giovanni received for this design
4 lire only,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> on May 23rd, 1483; but it cost 2,654
lire 52 c. to restore.</p>

<h4><i>The Phrygian Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>Of this Sibyl also nothing is known, though
she too has been confounded with the Delphic
Sibyl. Most of the longer lists, however, include
both. From the label designating her we learn
that she prophesied at Ancyra. She is here
brought before us attired in what we may suppose
the artist intended to represent Phrygian or semi-Oriental
dress. She holds aloft in her left hand

<p>Luigi di Ruggiero (<i>l’Armellino</i>) and Vito di
Marco are generally reputed to have devised and
executed this design, but no record exists on the
subject. The cost of restoration was 2,433 lire
91 c.</p>

<h4><i>The Hellespontine Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>The inscription beneath the feet of this Sibyl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49<a class="hidep" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
says that she was born on Trojan soil, and was,
according to Heraclides, a contemporary of Cyrus.
Hence, no doubt, she also has been confused
with the Erythraean Sibyl. It is very probable
indeed, as we have before hinted, that time, tradition,
and the varying expressions of different
writers have divided the personality of that one
Sibyl into several, according to the various places
that she is reported to have visited.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>The figure is a graceful one, but suggests
somewhat gigantic proportions. Her hair flows
over her shoulders, though partially confined by
ribbons, and crowned with a jewelled diadem. In
her left hand she holds a half-open book. Her
robe is loosely confined by a small girdle set with
gems.</p>

<p>On her left, a tablet is borne by two columns,
seated in front of which are a Wolf and a Lion
(the <i>Marzocco</i>), with their hands amicably clasped:
an allusion perhaps to the then recent treaty
between Siena and Florence.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> The inscription on

<p>This fine design was the work of Neroccio di
Bartolommeo di Benedetto Landi in 1483,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and is
a noble specimen of his style. We do not know
what he received for the work, but it is probable
that it was the same sum as that given to Matteo
di Giovanni. Nor, as we have seen, do we know
who executed this and the adjacent designs.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>

<h4><i>The Libyan Sibyl.</i></h4>

<p>According to Pausanias, the Libyan was the
oldest of all the Sibyls, and was the daughter of
Zeus and Lamia. More than this nothing is
known of her, but her label tells us that she is
spoken of by Euripides. She is a striking figure,
her black marble face, neck, hands and feet, producing
a remarkable effect. She is veiled and
crowned with a garland of flowers. In her left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
hand she grasps a small open scroll, while in her
right she shows an open book with the words:</p>

<p>Guidoccio Cozzarelli was the author of this

though that these designs were all paid for at
about the same rate.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The expense of its restoration
was 2,352 lire 16 c.</p>

<h3>6. THE NORTH TRANSEPT.</h3>

<p>This Transept is covered with three large designs,
all executed during the Rectorship of Alberto
Aringhieri; two of which, at least, may have some
political significance.</p>

<p>The first we come to <span class="locked">is—</span></p>

<h4><i>The Expulsion of Herod</i> (No. 27).</h4>

<p>This vast composition, designed by Benvenuto
Giovanni del Guasta in 1484–85, and for which he
received 78 lire,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> is full of charming grouping and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
delightful suggestion. It not impossibly alludes
to the expulsion, which had then but recently
taken place, of Pandolfo Petrucci and his followers.
It must be remembered that, though Siena at
this period was not involved in important external
historical events, her internal history was one long
record of party faction and strife, in which Aringhieri
himself played a not unimportant part.
(Ill. IX.)</p>

<p>Benvenuto was a consummate draughtsman,
and he was ably supported here by Bastiano di
Francesco, who designed the delightful border of
winged lions that frames the picture (Ill. XI.), and
made sixty letters of marble for the same work.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p class="smaller">(The entire panel)</p></div></div>

<p>We find several notices as to sums paid to workmen
for executing this frieze, but only one speaks
also of work on the design itself. From this, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55<a class="hidep" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
we learn that it was executed by Bernardino
Antonio and Cristofano di Pietro Paolo del Quarantotto.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
The other workmen employed on the
frieze were Vito di Marco,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> and Bartolommeo di
Domenico.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> With the exception of Vito di Marco,
we have no record of these men, apart from
notices of their work done on this Pavement.
Perhaps they were scholars or apprentices of the
better-known masters, and therefore not recorded
more particularly. We also read that certain
millers, by name Giusto Giovanni and Michele di
Ludovicho, were paid 15 lire 14 c. for the porterage
of 7,870 lbs. of black marble used in this design,
and that “del onperadore.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> (Ill. X.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
The composition is most graceful and full of
force. It illustrates an episode in the struggle
between Herod Antipas and his brother-in-law
Aretas, as a result of which the former had to
evacuate his kingdom. The picture has been
well restored, a re-engraving of the marble slabs
on the old lines having been, to a large extent,
sufficient for the main work, though the frieze
has had to be entirely renewed. A group of
soldiers, among whom is one extremely striking
man’s figure in full armour, has been particularly
successful. Over this group, in a high tree, an
eagle maybe seen protecting her nest of young
ones from the attacks of a serpent, possibly alluding
to the same political events referred to above.
The charming cherubs, supporting a tablet in the
upper part of the composition, upon which is engraved
a long quotation from Josephus, describing
the scene depicted, have been renewed, and the
damaged originals transported to the Museum of
the Opera.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> With them is also the original tablet,
which curiously enough on removal was found to
be a memorial slab of an earlier date, bearing on
the reverse side a fine effigy of a cleric.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>The last restoration of this design took place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
between the years 1869–1878 and, together with
the Pavement around it, cost 2,156 lire 63 c.;
while that of the friezes, around this and the next
design, cost another 3,490 lire 12 c.</p>

<p>Beyond this fine scene we come to another,
still more remarkable, if not quite so pleasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<h4><i>The Massacre of the Innocents</i> (No. 26).</h4>

<p>This, perhaps, is the most striking of all the
scenes on the Pavement, and as interesting historically
as artistically. The artist who designed it,
Matteo di Giovanni Bartoli, has thrown into it all
the force of his fancy and skill. It is extraordinarily
full of life, and vivid with imagination. The same
artist executed certainly three, if not four, more
designs of the same subject, two of them being
pictures still existing in Siena itself;<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> and it is
extremely interesting to compare his treatment of
it in all these three. Authorities differ as to the
dates of these two paintings, but admittedly there
was an interval of ten years between them. That
in S. Agostino, and most probably also the very
similar painting by the same artist at Naples,
come in point of date almost immediately subsequent
to this design for the Pavement, and resemble
it very closely. At this period all Italy
was convulsed with horror at the awful Sack and
Destruction of Otranto, which had occurred on
the 11th of August, 1480.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> We read that 1,200
persons were massacred, and that most of the
children were sold as slaves. The shock to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
Christian world was so terrible that the Pope,
Sixtus IV., in an Encyclical addressed to all the
cities of Italy, called their attention to the disaster,
pointed out to them that none of them, however
remote, was safe, and implored them, setting aside
their party divisions, to combine in the cause of
mutual protection against the Moslem. Alfonso,
Duke of Calabria, son of Ferdinand, King of Naples,
then living as ruler in Siena, was hastily recalled
to take command of an expedition against the
common enemy: and it is, I submit, not straining
a theory too far, to suppose, that Matteo di
Giovanni may have been directed to design these
scenes on the Pavement of the Duomo, for the
Church of S. Agostino, and for the Church of
Sta. Caterina a Formello at Naples, as an object
lesson to recall to the public mind, through the
medium of a Scriptural Tragedy, the horrors to
be endured at the hands of the unspeakable Turk.
They are all executed with a force and a suggestiveness,
so vivid as to be painful in their intensity.
The successful results of these three probably inspired
the fourth,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> which is somewhat less ferocious,
and certainly more graceful and pleasing.</p>

<p class="smaller">(The entire panel)</p></div></div>

<p>Unable to use on the Pavement the brilliant
pigments so lavishly employed in the paintings,
the artist has introduced, wherever possible, marbles
of many and varied colours; and when upon
these multi-coloured materials are super-imposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61<a class="hidep" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
most elaborate designs, the whole produces the
effect of a gorgeous piece of bizarre jewellery.
Herod sits on a splendid Renaissance throne of
carved marble, in a colonnade, adorned with panels<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
of classical scenes. A sportive frieze of marble
Bacchanals is introduced along the top of the composition,
broken by circular windows, from which
groups of impish children look down complacently
and even laughingly, on the dreadful slaughter
below. The armour of Herod and his soldiers
is of the most magnificent kind, and we may
notice again the artist’s affection for finishing a
clasp with the head of an animal or a human
being.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> (Ill. XII.)</p>

<p>It is evident from the style of this work that
it is by Matteo di Giovanni Bartoli, and his
authorship has never been questioned, though
there is no record of any commission or payment
to him. The date of its execution (1481) is fixed
by Tizio,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> and by two records of payments for
materials used upon it.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
We have no record as to who executed the
very charming frieze of <i>putti</i> and dragons, which
borders the bottom and the left side of this picture;
nor that of greyhounds and fountains, which
incloses the other sides, and it is not easy to
suggest any reason why two such different designs
should have been employed for the same picture.
They are evidently designed by different hands,
and were probably executed like the other friezes
by the Cathedral workmen mentioned above.
(Ill. XIII.)</p>

<p>The whole work has been apparently restored
several times; for we find in the notes of Abate
Faluschi,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> that it was restored in 1790 by
Matteo Pini, after the designs of Carlo Amidei,
and at this very day some of the worn-out stones
are being renewed, and the line of drawing re-trepanned
and stuccoed.</p>

<p>The third picture in this transept is:</p>

<h4><i>The Relief of Bethulia by Judith.</i> (Judith,
cap. xiii., xiv., and xv.) (No. 25.)</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64<a class="hidep" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Whether this picture had any political or semi-political
reference we do not know. The small
fortress-towns in the Sienese contado were at
this time continually being relieved and changing
hands, but we cannot now identify this scene with
any particular event. It is interesting, though, to
note that it was planned during the Rectorship of
Savino di Matteo di Guido Savino, who was, on
January 26th, 1480, deposed from his post for
being one of the “Riformatori.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>The notices as to this work are few and vague:
but we know from Tizio<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> that it was laid down in
1473, and further that the frieze of “reels” (<i>naspatoio</i>),
surrounding it, was executed by Urbano
di Pietro da Cortona, Giovanni di Stefano di
Giovanni, Bartolomeo di Domenico Calabrone
and Francesco di Bartolomeo (perhaps his son).<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
It is generally supposed that the design itself was
the work either of Urbano da Cortona or of
Matteo di Giovanni Bartoli, and the execution is
attributed to Antonio Federighi.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> (Ill. XIV.)
However this may be, it is a work full of charm,
recalling examples of the most poetic period of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66<a class="hidep" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Florentine art. As usual in work of this period,
several episodes of the story are told in various
parts of the picture. On the extreme right, now
much injured, and partly obliterated by the Pisani’s
pulpit, we can still trace Holofernes’ tent, and the
gruesome tragedy therein enacted. Above the
middle of the picture, over the hillside, upon which
bloom myriad flowers amid purling brooks, comes
Judith, a figure of extreme grace, followed by her
maid, who bears on her head a basket, containing
the tyrant’s head.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> (Ill. XV.) To the left
is the towered city of Bethulia, from which issue
troops of horsemen, intent upon victory in the
fight, which is depicted in the centre of the composition.
Beside the gate of the city, one may
notice a group of a knight with his squire arranging
the harness of his horse. (Ill. XVI.) We may
also remark the introduction here of birds. In the
extreme left corner are two parent birds, sitting
in a bush, guarding their young ones in a nest,
whilst above Holofernes’ tent are perched two
waiting ravens.</p>

<p>This work was also restored, or, as Abate
Faluschi puts it with much truth, “modernized”
(<i>modernata</i>) by Carlo Amidei and Matteo Pini
in 1790, so that we cannot now know how much
of the original work has perished. It is not unlikely
that, in any case, it may have been a composite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68<a class="hidep" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
design from the hand of more than one
artist. It is, however, worth noting that, whereas
the design last described depends largely for its
effect on varied colour, this one, the <i>Expulsion of
Herod</i>, and the other contemporary picture of the
<i>Story of Jephthah</i>, presently to be described, show
how much can be done by the use of line alone.</p>

<p>Ascending a wide step, we come to a work of
much older and more archaic character, which I
propose to include in my seventh division.</p>

<h3>7. THE CHOIR AMBULATORY.</h3>

<h4><i>The Story of Joshua’s Victory over the Amorites</i>
(No. 22), <i>and the Slaughter of the Five Kings</i>.</h4>

<p>This work, with the others beside it on the
same platform right across the church, was executed
about the year 1424, during the Rectorship of
Bartolommeo Cecchi. I have already, in my introduction,
referred to the difficulty in separating
the work done here by Domenico di Niccolo del
Coro, from that of Paolo di Martino. Both men
appear from the documents to have held the post
of Capo-maestro of the Duomo. Tizio mentions
distinctly<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> this design as among those executed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
1424, and Milanesi in his Documenti<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> repeating
that date, assures us that it was among works
to be attributed to Domenico himself: thereby
pointedly confuting Vasari’s assertion, that it and
those adjoining it were from designs by Duccio.
On the same page, however, of the Documenti,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> we
find a notice, dated 1426, of payment to a paper
dealer, named Domenico di Francesco, for ten
squares of “<i>fogli reagli</i>” used by “<i>Paolo nostro</i>,”
for a design for the “<i>storia di Giesue</i>:” and Milanesi
himself in his <i>Discorso sulla Storia Artistica Senese</i><a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>
contradicts his former statement, attributes this
design and that of <i>Samson</i> (No. 14) in the opposite
aisle of the Choir, also hitherto given by him to
Domenico, to Paolo, and dates them both two years
later than in his previous assertion.</p>

<p>It is an interesting picture, though at present
sadly in need of judicious restoration. The greater
part of it is occupied by the battle scene, but up
in the top left-hand corner we see the bodies of
the Five Kings hung up to five stakes, and below
them a yawning cavern. Some of the figures are
expressed with considerable force, and the fifteenth-century
armour of the soldiers is most quaint and
curious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
The work here, and that of the story of <i>Samson</i>
above referred to, do resemble each other, and
have not much in common with the known work
of Domenico del Coro. I think we may, therefore,
fairly consider them as from Paolo’s designs; and
supposing that these artists worked in collaboration
on the whole scheme of this platform, that, when
Tizio spoke of these designs, he described a project
not completely carried out until two years later.</p>

<p>On either side of the main picture are single
figures <i>Joshua</i> and <i>Solomon</i> (Nos. 23 and 24).
The first of these Milanesi, in his <i>Discorso</i>,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> gives
unhesitatingly to Paolo di Martino, with the same
date as the before-mentioned larger design. But
of the figure of <i>Solomon</i>, now more than half concealed
under the marble balustrade of the altar of
S. Ansano, a mention exists in a document in the
Archivio dell’ Opera, dated 10th of August, 1447.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
This was during the Rectorship of Giovanni di
Pietro Ghezzi (Borghesi), who held the post from
1437 to 1448,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> and we find a notice dated June,
1444,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> which may refer to this very work, although
it is not mentioned specifically. It is a permission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
to the Rector to fill up this portion of the Pavement
with such a design, as may seem to him suitable
and pleasing.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>The whole platform, or step, upon which all these
designs are inlaid had been bordered, along the
top and bottom, by a delightful frieze of <i>putti</i>,
executed in 1423, by Agostino di Niccolo of Siena,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
and Bastiano di Corso of Florence.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Of the former
artist we know but little, but of the work of the
latter, in company with his son Corso, on the
pavement before the Cathedral doors, we find
several notices, to which I have referred already,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
A notice, dated 25th March, 1447,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> speaks of other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
frieze-work done by father and son, “<i>sotto la
tribuna di verso l’altare di Santa Chaterina</i>.” This
work appears to have perished, or been superseded,
unless, as is by no means impossible or improbable,
we may attribute to him the frieze round the
<i>Massacre of the Innocents</i> described above, the
authors of which are unknown and unidentified.</p>

<p>Agostino and Bastiano’s frieze is a very graceful
one, but it would seem, judging from the dates of
the documents, as if the latter artist had succeeded
the former in the work: for the first document
speaks of payment made to Agostino up to
December 30th, 1423, whereas both those commissioning
Bastiano are dated the same month,
with no allusion to previous or contemporary employment
of any other artist.</p>

<p>Three more steps bring us to the passage which
runs round behind the altar. Here originally was
some of the oldest work, but to all appearance
now it would seem to be almost the most modern.
In five circles we find the five Cardinal Virtues,
the first of whom is</p>

<h4><i>Fortitude</i> (No. 21).</h4>

<p>On this spot, as I have already said in my first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
chapter, Marchesse d’Adamo<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> and his companions,
the Comacene sculptors at work in Siena in 1406,
are generally supposed to have executed the earliest
figure-subject on the Pavement, about which we
now possess authoritative information. There is
nothing, however, to show their work. The figure
is imposing and dignified in composition, but the
workmanship on it is poor and somewhat paltry.</p>

<p>Of the four other Virtues, <i>Justice</i>, <i>Christian
Piety</i>, <i>Prudence</i>, and <i>Temperance</i> (Nos. 20, 19, 18,
and 17), there is little definite to be said. Padre
Micheli<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> following Milanesi<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> gives 1406 as the
possible date of the two first, 1380 as that of the
other two; but there is nothing in their present
condition to prove either one date or the other.
The only thing that may be noticed is that the
restoration of <i>Justice</i> and <i>Prudence</i> shows more
vigour of conception and boldness of line, with far
more satisfactory results than have been shown in
the case of <i>Fortitude</i> and <i>Temperance</i>. <i>Fortitude</i>,
we know, was restored in 1839, and <i>Temperance</i>
perhaps at the same time. <i>Christian Piety</i> is half
covered by the great lectern, and so obliterated
by the feet of readers and singers as to be now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
almost indistinguishable. The frieze of ladders
(<i>scaglioni</i>) and thorns (<i>spini</i>), surrounding these
works, is said to have been executed in 1406.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>Descending again three steps corresponding to
those on the opposite side of the church we come
to the design of</p>

<h4><i>Samson slaying the Philistines with the jawbone
of an ass</i> (No. 14).</h4>

<p class="in0">alluded to above. The workmanship and style of
this picture certainly resembles that of <i>Joshua
and the Five Kings</i> on the north side, but it is a
finer and a grander piece of work. The grouping
is bolder and more forcible. Samson, a giant
figure, is administering chastisement to a Philistine
in the manner of a schoolmaster to a naughty boy.
He holds aloft, not merely the jawbone of an ass,
but the whole skull. Some of his opponents lie
slaughtered on the ground, and a crowd of them
cowers away in terror, to the right of the composition.
(Ill. XX.)</p>

<p>This design, as we have said before, is mentioned
by Tizio<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> among those projected in 1424, and was
probably executed by Paolo di Martino in 1426.
On either side of it are the single figures of <i>Moses</i>
(No. 16) and <i>Judas Maccabeus</i> (No. 15). Milanesi
in his <i>Discorso</i><a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> attributes the figure of <i>Moses</i>, like
that of <i>Joshua</i> (No. 23), to Paolo di Martino in
1426, while that of <i>Judas Maccabeus</i>, now hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
almost entirely by the balustrade of the altar of
the Blessed Sacrament, and also recorded by Tizio
(in the notice already more than once referred to),
Padre Micheli<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> supposes, and there is no evidence
to contradict him, to have been the work of Domenico
del Coro in 1424.</p>

<p>Before descending the step to the South Transept,
I would wish to draw the reader’s attention
to the fact, that this step does not run parallel with
the steps above it, and that the platform is narrower
at this end than at the other. Consequently, the
design of <i>Samson</i> and those in the transept, now
to be described, are all more or less irregular in
shape. Whether this is due to some structural
defect in the original building, or to some inequality
in the foundation, it is impossible now
to say.</p>

<h3>8. THE SOUTH TRANSEPT.</h3>

<p>This transept is complicated in its general plan
by the irregularity above referred to. It contains
<i>two</i> pictures to correspond to the <i>one</i> (the <i>Story
of Judith</i>) on the opposite side of the church, and
is further broken up by varied designs, of different
sizes, before what was once the Porta del Perdono,
and is now the Cappella del Voto.</p>

<p>The first picture, that we come to, is very remarkable,
especially since it is the only one which
is neither biblical, symbolical, nor heraldic. It
professes to be a portrait of the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<h4><i>Emperor Sigismund</i> (No. 13),</h4>

<p class="p0 in0">who in 1433 was a visitor for some months to the
city. (Ill. XXI.)</p>

<p>Confusion has arisen among Sienese writers as
to the identity of this portrait, and some have
said that it represents the Emperor Charles IV.
This probably arose from the fact, which is difficult
now to explain, that Tizio,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> under date 1424,
after describing, as we have seen, the above-mentioned
designs, goes on to say that “in the time
immediately following, to the right, by the iron
grating, a Portrait of the Emperor was laid down
on the pavement; and not much later the Story
of Absalom hanging by his hair to the oak, under
the direction of the same Operaio.” With the
<i>Story of Absalom</i> I will deal presently, but Tizio
must have made a very grave mistake here in
dates; since we have two notices<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> proving that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
Domenico di Bartolo di Ghezzo d’Asciano was
the designer of this work in 1434, for which he
received 16 lire; whilst another notice,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> dated
December 2nd in the same year, records the
payment of 3 lire 10 soldi to a workman named
Giacomo d’Antonio for assistance in executing it.</p>

<p>As regards the Operaio at this period some
difficulty arises, since Padre Micheli asserts that
Bartolommeo Cecchi only held the post up to 1430.
From the Borghesi and the Faluschi MS. lists,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>
however, we find that Cecchi (Bartolommeo di
Gio. di Cecco) was still in office on October 25th,
1434, but was apparently compelled to resign on
account of his having married a certain Corsa,
and had children by her.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> We read further that
he was succeeded, 1434–5, by Giacomo della
Quercia, who held the post until his death on
February 8th, 1438.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> From the second of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79<a class="hidep" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
notices above referred to we gather, therefore,
that the work was certainly ordered by Bartolomeo
Cecchi, even if, as is possible, it was completed
under the direction of his successor.</p>

<p class="floatr">[BY PIETRO DEL MINELLA (?)</p>
<p class="floatc">XVII. THE STORY OF ABSALOM (No. 12)</p></div></div>

<p>The Emperor, crowned and sceptre in hand, sits
on a splendid throne, under a marble canopy, hung
with garlands. Four counsellors sit beside him,
two on each hand; and two tall pages carry his
orb and sword. It is worth noting, that this design
appears to have early required restoration, because
we read in a notice quoted above,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> under date
1485, of black marble being brought from Chasciano,
among other things, “<i>raconciare la storia
del onperadore</i>.” At the latest restoration (1869–78)
a sum of 616 lire 49 c. was expended on it.</p>

<p>Beside this design, as I have remarked above,
is the very striking picture of</p>

<h4><i>Absalom hanging by his hair</i> (No 12).</h4>

<p class="in0">(Ill. XVII.). No design on the Pavement attracts
so much attention as this. The bold, vigorous
outlines of the white figures set against the black
marble background, the vivid and forcible composition
of the picture, and the remarkably decorative
foliage of the two trees, almost Japanese
in character, from one of which Absalom is hanging,
arrest the eye and the attention of even the
most casual visitor. We find a notice in the
Archivio dell’ Opera,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> stating that it was commenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
after the 11th of July, 1447, during the
Rectorship of Giovanni Borghesi, and while Pietro
di Tommaso Minella was Capo-maestro.</p>

<p>The design of it is generally attributed to
Minella himself, and from the high merit of its
conception and composition this is very probable,
but there are no records to prove more than that
he superintended its execution. Tizio<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> includes
it in the list of works to which he gives the date
1424, but this, as I have already pointed out, is an
obvious mistake.</p>

<p>Below these two designs we come to another
fine large picture, similar to those in the North
Transept. It represents</p>

<h4><i>The Story of Jephthah’s Victory, and the Sacrifice
of his Daughter</i> (No. 11).</h4>

<p>The greater part of the composition is taken up
with the Fight and Victory; and the expression
of violent action on the part of the combatants is
wonderfully forcible. To the left Jephthah, on his
charger, a crown on his head, and clothed like a
Roman emperor, gives orders to his men. Near
him we notice a charming group of two young men
conversing, one of whom, a negro, stands out from
the picture with startling vividness. (Ill. XXIII.).
Above, in the background, Jephthah’s daughter is
seen coming out of the city gates, with a joyous
crowd of maiden companions, to greet her victorious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
father; while, still farther into the top left-hand
corner, we may see the unhappy father, in a
tiny temple, sacrificing his daughter, in fulfilment
of his rash vow. Of this work we find two notices
in the Archives,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> the first, dealing with advances
made on two occasions to the artist, and the other,
recording payment for the complete work. The
artist employed upon it was Bastiano di Francesco
di Sano, of whom we have already spoken, and he
appears in this case to have been both designer
and executant. The work seems to have been
commenced either late in 1481 or at the beginning
of 1482, but not finished until the end of 1484 or
early in 1485. Not that the artist was idle, for, as
we have seen, he had work to do elsewhere on the
Pavement in the interval, besides various sculptures
commissioned by the cathedral authorities.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>
He received for it in all a sum of 2,555 lire. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
restoration in 1869–78 cost 2,664 lire 8 c. (Ill.
XXIII.)</p>

<p>Below this design, the plan of the floor is very
much broken up. The reader must, however, bear
in mind that up to the year 1661, when Pope
Alexander VII. (Fabio Chigi) began to build the
Cappella della Madonna del Voto, to contain the
famous wonder-working picture of the Madonna,
Protectress of Siena, this portion of the Pavement
lay before the <i>Porta del Perdono</i>, to which I have
made frequent reference at the commencement of
this chapter. This Porta del Perdono must have
been a sort of <i>Porta Sacra</i>, opened only in solemn
state in the years of Jubilee.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Fragments of it still
exist, and may be seen built into the outer wall of
the bay, next to the above-mentioned Chapel; and
the inscription, quoted in the note, is now to be found
over the left hand doorway of the Western façade.
There are many notices still to be found dealing
with this important entrance. Several, to which
we have referred already, dealt with the adornment
of the wide step or platform, that apparently
led to it from the outside. All this has now
perished. Inside, however, the floor has fared
better, and the beautiful painting by Maestro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Gregorio (1423), which hung above an altar<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> once
erected over this door, and belonging to the
Tolomei family, still exists in the Museum of the
Opera del Duomo. It was, no doubt, the fact
that long periods of time passed between each successive
opening of this door, which gave Antonio
di Federigo, or Federighi, the idea of placing
before it his beautiful design of the</p>

<h4><i>Seven Ages in the Life of Man. Infancy, Childhood,
Adolescence, Youth, Manhood, Age, and Decrepitude</i>
(No. 6).</h4>

<p>All seven are treated with a <i>naïveté</i> and grace
impossible to surpass. (Ill. XVIII.) Not only the
figures themselves, but also their accessories; the
budding blossoms, the over-blown flowers, and the
handsome classical tomb to which “<i>Decrepitas</i>” is
tottering, show a taste and feeling beyond description.
Federighi, we read, designed and executed
this delightful work in 1475,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> and, at about the
same date, the friezes of stags, and perhaps the
beautiful lily (Ill. XXIV.), candlestick (Ill. XXII.)
and geometrical pattern, in the angle formed by the
<i>Seven Ages</i> with the Cupola designs, were also laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85<a class="hidep" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
down; but we cannot be sure whether they are by the
same master or not. All that we do know for certain
about them is drawn from two notices,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> recording payments
to a certain Bartolino of Massa da Carrara for
marble for work in the Duomo, among which the
“frieze of stags” (<i>fregio del cervio</i>), and a frieze at
the Porta del Perdono are especially mentioned.</p>

<p>The work visible here now is wholly a restoration;
but Federighi’s <i>Seven Ages</i> may be seen
nearly complete in the Museum of the Opera, together
with part of the frieze of stags. Fragments
of the other friezes and borders are also to be
found, laid down outside the north aisle of the
Cathedral, in the little courtyard between it and
the present Palace of the Archbishop.</p>

<p>Federighi’s work, when removed (1869–1878),
was replaced by the fine copy, which we now see,
executed by Leopoldo Maccari and Giuseppe
Radicchi. The cost of restoration, at this date,
of the entire angle amounted to 22,254 lire 26 c.</p>

<p>There is no record of any early work ever having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
existed between this design and the destroyed
Porta, which probably stood nearly on the same
spot as the doorway of the present Cappella del
Voto. Perhaps the erection of this newer archway
created a wider space. However this may
have been, designs for the four Theological Virtues,
<i>Religion</i>, <i>Faith</i>, <i>Hope</i>, and <i>Charity</i> were made by
Carlo Amidei, and executed here by Matteo Pini<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> in
1780. These designs were not admired, and, moreover,
did not stand the wear of time as the older
work had done. They were, therefore, removed
in 1870, and replaced by entirely new designs,
made by Professor Alessandro Franchi, and executed,
under his direction, by Leopoldo Maccari.</p>

<p>Before commencing the description of the last
two sections of the Pavement, I must remind my
reader once more, that, after a great part of it had
been laid down, an important radical change took
place in the interior arrangements of the Duomo.</p>

<p>Up to the commencement of the sixteenth century
the great High Altar, glorified by Duccio’s
grand <i>Maestà</i>, stood in the centre of the Cathedral,
under the Cupola. This part, therefore, of the
floor was not decorated. But, on the other hand,
that above the steps, where the Choir and Altar
now are, was so adorned.</p>

<p>By the advice of Baldassare Peruzzi, Capo-maestro
in 1532, the whole arrangement was
changed. In accordance with his plans, and under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
his direction, Choir and Altar were moved further
east, and placed in the position that they now occupy.</p>

<p>Of the original floor decorations, then, all that
now remain <i>in situ</i> are the designs in the Choir
Ambulatory above-mentioned, and Domenico del
Coro’s work, to be described shortly. Fragments of
the older work, removed to make way for the alterations,
still exist; and, until 1878, were used to fill up
three of the hexagons under the Cupola. At that
date, as we shall presently see, they were finally removed
to the Museum of the Opera, and replaced
by modern work of an entirely different character.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Let us now proceed eastwards and examine</p>

<h3>9. THE CHOIR AND ALTAR-STEPS.</h3>

<p>Before the lowest step of the High Altar, we
find one large design, and on either side of it seven
small ones; the whole being inclosed by a long
processional frieze.</p>

<p>The principal design represents</p>

<h4><i>Abraham’s Sacrifice</i> (No. 56).</h4>

<p>The whole story is told in different parts of
the picture, culminating in the central group of
the Sacrifice itself. The smaller designs represent
the following subjects.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>On the right of the Altar:</p>

<p>1. <i>Elisha raising the son of the Shunammite.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>A prophet with an open book before him.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>Eve on her knees.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
4. <i>A woman, holding in her hand an open book.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>Another woman, with a mirror, representing
Prudence.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>The Sacrifice of Melchisedec.</i></p>

<p>7. <i>A seated woman, with a child.</i></p>

<p>On the left:</p>

<p>1. <i>The old Tobit, with his son, Tobias, and the
Angel Raphael. At their feet a dog.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>A woman, representing Charity.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>Adam kneeling.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>A prophet, gazing up to Heaven.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>Another woman, seated, holding a book in her
hand.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>The Sacrifice of Abel.</i></p>

<p>7. <i>Another woman, seated, with a child.</i></p>

<p>A great procession runs all round these, composed
of men and women of all ages, shown in
half-length, representing</p>

<h4><i>The Children of Israel seeking the Promised Land</i>.</h4>

<p>All these designs were the work of Domenico
di Jacopo di Pace Beccafumi, called Il Mecharino,
and we read in Alfonso Landi’s <i>Descrizione del Pavimento</i>
and in the notes of Abate Faluschi<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> that they
were executed between the years 1544 and 1546.
The writers refer to (as their authority) the Libro
Giallo dell’ Assunta of the Cathedral Archives, and
state that the artist received 8,004 lire 19 c. for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
work. The subjects chosen fitly complete the
general scheme of the floor, surrounding, as they do,
the Altar, with symbolical imagery from the Old
Testament. The repentant Adam and Eve, the
three Typical Sacrifices, Prophets, Virtues, the
Guardian Angel, and around the whole a host of
believers hastening to the Promised Land. Some of
the drawing is very beautiful and extremely decorative,
notably the frieze. The beautiful figure of
Eve, indeed, has been even attributed to Giovanni
Antonio Bazzi (<i>Il Sodoma</i>), who is known to have
received a commission to make at least one design
for this floor.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> This, however, is wholly uncertain,
and cannot now be verified. The workmen employed
here, and the sums they received respectively,
we learn from the above sources and from
Milanesi.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> They were Bernardino di Giacomo,
who received for his labour 475 scudi, and Pellegrino
di Pietro, 151 sc., 1. 4. These men were
probably masons in the regular employ of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Cathedral, for Bernardino, at least, seems to have
been employed on all the work done at this time.</p>

<p>Descending three steps we come to Domenico
del Coro’s design of David, to which we have had
occasion to refer already more than once.</p>

<h4><i>David as King and Psalmist, and David and
Goliath.</i></h4>

<p>In a circular panel, David, as King, sits on a
throne with a sort of zither on his knee, while,
with his right hand, he points to an open book of
Psalms, propped upon a lectern by his side. Around
him stand four courtiers holding each a primitive
musical instrument:—a small organ, a tambourine,
a mandoline, and a viol. The whole picture is
surrounded by a graceful cornice of leaves. On
either side of the central picture, in a lozenge-shaped
space, is a single figure; on the one side
is the youth David slinging his stone, and upon
the other the giant Goliath falling backwards.
It is curious that Goliath has a hole in his forehead,
although the stone has not reached him;
while, at the same time, the stone is both still
in David’s sling and in the air above Goliath.
The figures in the central composition are fine,
but much altered by restoration. Those of
David and Goliath are more original, and have
probably suffered less. These designs are undoubtedly
the work of Domenico del Coro,
executed during the Rectorship of Bartolommeo
Cecchi: and the cornice and frieze work around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
them is that of Agostino da Niccolo, for we read
special notice of this fact in a memorandum of
payment to the latter, dated June 6th, 1423.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>Below another step we come to the largest and
most pretentious of Beccafumi’s designs.</p>

<h4><i>Moses’ Ascent of Mount Sinai, his Receipt of the
Tables of the Law, and the Idolatry of the
Children of Israel</i> (No. 52). (Ill. XXV.)</h4>

<p>The story is told in six parts, combined into one
large picture. Above, in the centre, Moses kneels
on the mountain top (α). The light of Heaven
streams over him, and he receives the Tables of
the Law into his outstretched hands. Below in
the centre he lifts the Tables over his head, to
dash them to pieces on the ground (δ). In the
upper <i>left</i>-hand corner, the Elders of Israel are
seen persuading Aaron, who points to Moses on
the mountain, to make the Golden Calf (β): in
the lower, we see him casting their gold and jewels
into the fire to make it (θ). In the lower <i>right</i>-hand
corner the Israelites are worshipping the
Calf (η), while above they are smitten with plague
and dying in agony (γ). This work appears to have
been originally commissioned by a certain Antonio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
d’Agostino del Vescovo, then Rector (1524);<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> but,
as we read from an inscription let into the beautiful
frieze that surrounds it, it was completed under
the direction of his successor, Francesco di Carlo
Tolomei. Beccafumi received on the 30th of
August, 1531, 120 scudi for these designs,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> according
to a valuation made for Tolomei by Baldassare
Peruzzi himself;<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> which suggests the idea that
these two great artists may have together planned
the new arrangements of the Choir, and a scheme
of decoration to adorn it, when complete. From
Landi and Faluschi we learn that the workmen
here employed<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> were the same Bernardino di
Giacomo, who now received for his work 969 scudi
13: Giacomo di Pietro Gallo, 133 sc. 6.8; Bartolommeo
di Pietro Gallo, 41 sc.; and Giovanni
d’Antonio Marinelli, called <i>il Mugnaino</i>, 486 sc.
To these Milanesi adds two more, not mentioned
by either of the above authorities: Niccolo Filippi
and Cristofano di Carbone.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Immediately below these scenes a long narrow
design, also by Beccafumi, shows</p>

<h4><i>Moses striking the Rock to bring water for the
thirsting Israelites</i> (No. 51).</h4>

<p>This is by far the most pleasing and successful
of Beccafumi’s works. We can see, from its very
simplicity, how much its charm depends upon
sheer skill of drawing. This work was executed
in 1525,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> but we do not find any record as to the
amount paid to him for it, or the workmen
employed upon it. Probably they were the
same as had carried out his previous designs.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
These scenes by Beccafumi provoked the most
extravagant admiration and applause from the
writers of the seventeenth, eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries; and as <i>tours de force</i>, and
specimens of a new kind of work, they are certainly
remarkable. They do not, however, succeed in
provoking that feeling of pleasure and charm, that
one experiences when studying the older and
simpler productions.</p>

<p>And now we come to the last section, and some
of the latest work.</p>

<h3>10. UNDER THE CUPOLA.</h3>

<p>This vast hexagonal space is divided into seven
hexagons and six lozenges. They all now contain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
scenes from the <i>Story of Elijah</i>, completing what
probably was Beccafumi’s original design. That
that artist <i>did</i> prepare designs for four of the
hexagons, for two of the lozenges and for a frieze,
we have abundant evidence, for we have no less
than five notices,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> between the 11th of March,
1518–19, and the 18th of June, 1524, in the
books of the Opera, of payment to him, not only
for his labour, but also for the paper used for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
cartoons. It is also to be noted that the commission
for this work was given him earlier than
that of any of the other works above described.
Upon these grounds, Professor Luigi Mussini,
writing on the Pavement,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> supposes that they
were executed in 1517, and likens them to Pinturicchio’s
work of eleven years before. A recent
writer in the Miscellanea Storica Senese,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> however,
contests this statement, and quotes a document
in the Archives dated 1562,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> which states
that a certain person, called there <i>Giovan Battista
nostro</i>, designed four scenes from the <i>Story of
Elijah</i> for the Duomo floor, which, we gather from
the same sources, were executed by the Cathedral
masons, Niccolo di Girolamo Gori, Domenico di
Pier Giovanni, and the same Bernardino di
Jacomo.</p>

<p>This Giovan Battista was Giovanni Battista di
Girolamo Sozzini, brother of Alessandro Sozzini,
Diarist of the last Siege of Siena. He was a
pupil of Beccafumi’s, and of his work, Scipio Bargagli
in his <i>Imprese</i> speaks in high praise, specially mentioning
some <i>mandorle</i> designed by him, “placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
<i>near</i> the grand works of the great Mecarino.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> To
add to these facts, we know that Sozzini retained
in his possession many drawings by Beccafumi,
and among them his cartoons for the floor. These
designs he sold to the architect Tiburzio Spannocchi,
and it is recorded in the Archives of the
Duomo,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> that the Cathedral authorities endeavoured,
but apparently unsuccessfully, to recover
them. Some of these have now, as we
know, found their way into the Public Picture
Gallery. These six designs differ in treatment
from Beccafumi’s other work, and the drawing
and composition of them is not so striking. The
large hexagons represent:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Compact between Elijah and Ahab</i> (in
the centre). (Ill. XIX.) No. 42.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>2. <i>Ahab’s Sacrifice</i> (to the left). No. 44.</p>

<p>3. <i>Elijah’s Sacrifice</i> (above). No. 41.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
4. <i>The Slaughter of the Prophets of Baal</i> (to
the right). No. 43.</p>

<p>The small ones:</p>

<p>5. <i>Ahab comes to meet Elijah.</i> No. 46.</p>

<p>6. <i>Elijah sends Obadiah to fetch Ahab.</i> No. 45.</p>

<p>It does not seem to me, however, that the learned
writer of the above-referred-to article brings forward
any <i>real</i> ground for doubting Beccafumi’s
authorship of these designs. The Document
quoted, and Scipio Bargagli, both speak of “<i>mandorle</i>,”
which appears to have been the technical
expression for the <i>lozenges</i> filling up the great
hexagon, in contradistinction to the words “<i>tondo</i>”
or “<i>esagono</i>,” used to describe the larger sections.
The documents dated 6th of September, 1521, and
18th of June, 1524, together expressly mention
four <i>tondi</i> and two <i>mandorle</i>, which exactly
accounts for the designs in question. It seems
unnecessary, therefore, to strain the word <i>mandorle</i>
to mean something else than its more
obvious meaning: and it is surely much more
probable, that the document and quotation, both
refer to designs for the remaining four <i>mandorle</i>,
which are generally supposed to have been filled
in by Carlo Amidei, and Matteo Pini in 1780.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>
However this may be, the smallness of the sum
paid for the designs, 75 soldi, makes the idea,
that it was a payment for drawings of any size,
even more improbable and absurd.</p>

<p>The three remaining hexagons, up to 1878,
contained fragments, and most interesting fragments,
of older work, which evidently once formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
part of the floor, where the High Altar now stands.
To the left, looking east, was a delightful design
representing the <i>Blind leading the Blind</i>. An old
man is holding one end of a stick, while a young
man, also blind, is grasping it at the other end.
The older man is just stepping over a precipice
into space. Below them is a delightful <i>putto</i>, holding
in one hand a mirror, and a label with the word
“<i>Notate</i>” upon it. This design we know to have
been the work of Antonio Federighi in 1459; and
for it he received 46 lire.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> It was apparently ordered
by the Rector, Benedetto di Biagio di Roberto,
and completed during the Directorate of
Cristofano Felice.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>The middle design illustrates the <i>Parable of the
Mote and the Beam</i>; and though it dates from
1374–5,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> strangely enough is now in the best preservation
of the three.</p>

<p>The third design was a scene of a stately-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
bearded man, giving alms to a woman with a child
in her arms. This is generally supposed to be
that work of Domenico del Coro<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> which is referred
to in a document dated 1433, as being placed by
him in the choir (then under the cupola) <i>from the
lectern downwards, in that place where they stand
to sing</i>,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> and for which he received 357 lire.</p>

<p>It is impossible now to tell what was the original
shape of these designs, or where they were
placed. But to fit them into the hexagons, they were
made into more or less complete triangles, the remainder
of the space being filled up with fragments
of old friezes, brought probably from the same
place.</p>

<p>In 1875, the fragments left of them, and of the
four later <i>mandorle</i>, were removed to the Museum
of the Opera, where they now are, and in 1878, all
seven were replaced by others, completing the <i>Story
of Elijah and Ahab</i>.</p>

<p>The subjects chosen are, for the larger ones:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
1. <i>Ahab mortally wounded.</i> No. 40.</p>

<p>2. <i>Elijah carried to Heaven in a Chariot of
Fire.</i> No. 38. (Ill. XXVI.)</p>

<p>3. <i>Elijah predicts the manner of Ahab’s death.</i>
No. 39.</p>

<p>For the smaller ones:</p>

<p>1. <i>Elijah fed by Ravens.</i> No. 47.</p>

<p>2. <i>Elijah raises the widow’s son.</i> No. 50.</p>

<p>3. <i>Elijah asks bread of the widow.</i> No. 49.</p>

<p>4. <i>Elijah anoints Jehu, King of Israel.</i> No. 48.</p>

<p>These designs were made by Professor Alessandro
Franchi, the present Director of the Accademia
delle Belle Arti, and were executed under
his direction by Leopoldo Maccari and Antonio
Radicchi.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> The smaller ones follow to some extent
the older lines, but in the larger ones, the artist
has struck out for himself; and, if the result is in
somewhat startling contrast to everything preceding
it, there is no doubt that his work is full of skill
and merit of a most scholarly and remarkable kind.
Under his care, and with the able support of the
above-mentioned two artists, aided by a generous
legacy of a former Rector, Cav. Pietro Bambagini
Galletti, the whole Pavement has undergone the
Restoration, to which I have referred so often,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>
and is now in as perfect a condition as constant
loving and intelligent care can keep it, without
entirely hoarding it from view.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> reader, having patiently followed me along
the intricacies of the Pavement, and the
ramifications of its history, will now like to know
something more detailed about the men who made
it. To satisfy this wish, I have collected from
various sources, chiefly from Milanesi, the following
notes.</p>

<p>Padre Micheli<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> gives no less than forty-one
names of workers of various sorts on the Pavement.
To these the writer in Miscellanea<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
adds three more; and if with them we include
the six artists and sculptors, who, since the middle
of the eighteenth century, and up to the present
day, have restored, replaced, and made additions,
we arrive at a total of more than fifty men, who
have, in one way or another, contributed to this
beautiful work.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
Of these, many remain but as names recorded
in documents concerning the Pavement, and are
heard of nowhere else; of others we catch a few
glimpses in the pages of Milanesi; about a dozen
were celebrated in their day as painters and sculptors,
in the somewhat limited world of Sienese
Art, and have left specimens of their work elsewhere;
while two alone, Pinturicchio and Beccafumi,
have attained world-wide fame.</p>

<p>I propose then to take the names of these men,
according to the dates of the first work contributed
by them to the Pavement.</p>

<p>Thus we begin with:</p>

<h3 class="lesser">1.  1369. <i>Antonio di Brunaccio.</i></h3>

<p>This earliest name, connected with work on the
Pavement, is of a man, about whom we do not
know very much. In 1362, we find him witnessing
two contracts made between the Operaio and
a certain Francesco di Tonghio, for woodwork
(stalls and a lectern) made for the Choir of the
Duomo. He is among the sculptors, whose names
are entered in the Book of Arts and Crafts of the
City of Siena, under date 1363, and in the following
year, he binds himself to do certain work in the
Cathedral, and the Cappella di Piazza. In 1369,
we read of his making a small lion, to adorn a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
fountain in the Palazzo Pubblico. He was, perhaps,
the son of a certain Brunaccio di Santa
Colomba, a sculptor, who signed the <i>Sculptors’
Brief</i> in the thirteenth century, quoted in the
<i>Nuovi Documenti</i>.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<h3 class="lesser">2.  1370. <i>Sano di Marco.</i></h3>

<p>This man’s name is also among those of the
sculptors working in Siena in 1363. Milanesi
mentions a daughter of his called Valentina, who
married a sculptor named Paolo di Pietro, of the
parish (<i>Popolo</i>) of San Stefano: but there is no
other record about him.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">3.  1370. <i>Francesco di Ser Antonio.</i></h3>

<p>Appears to have been a painter, and we find his
name on the list of artists flourishing in Siena in
1402.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> He was also consulted in 1376 as to the
walls of the Cappella di Piazza; and was witness
to a contract made with Giacomo di Buonfredi,
called <i>Corbello</i>, for certain work done on the façade
of the Duomo. He must not, however, be confused
with Francesco d’Antonio di Francesco, the
goldsmith, who lived many years later.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="ilb">
<h3 class="lesser left b0">4.  1376. <i>Matteo di Bartolo.</i></h3>
<h3 class="lesser left">5.  1380. <i>Nanni di Corsino.</i></h3>
</div></div>

<p>Of these men, and their work, nothing is known,
but the notices already quoted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<h3 class="lesser">6.  1398. <i>Sano, or Ansano di Maestro Matteo.</i></h3>

<p>Of this sculptor and architect, notices exist from
1392 to 1429. He was a native of Siena, and
might have been the son of the Matteo di Bartolo
mentioned above, although we cannot prove it.
He married twice: first, Cristofora di Cecco di
Domenico; and secondly, after her death, a certain
Madonna Bartolommea. In 1402, we find him
witness to a contract, given to Giacomo di Giovanni,
“<i>a key-maker</i>” (<i>chiavaio</i>) to make an iron
railing round the pulpit in the Duomo in Siena.
In 1404, he held the post of <i>Petrone</i>, or valuer, to
the Commune, and Director of the City water-supply,
and was re-appointed in 1407. In 1408
and in 1409, we also find him recommending Cristoforo
di Francesco, a Sienese sculptor, first to the
Orvieto Cathedral authorities, and then to the Signoria
of Siena. He was, in 1416, elected Castellan
of the fortalice of Montalcino, but, being engaged
to assist Giacomo della Quercia in his work on the
Fonte Gaia, sent Maestro Giovanni di Giacomo,
as his lieutenant.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> He was Capo-maestro of the
Duomo at Orvieto for various periods during the
years 1407–1425, and during that time he made
the font there.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> He also added a new chapel to
the Cathedral. In 1416, he too was among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
artists employed on the Font in the Baptistery at
Siena, and in 1426–27, he was called to Perugia
to superintend the drainage works of Lake Thrasymene.
Among the Sienese State Records of
1427–28 are three letters from the Signoria to
him, apologizing for not sending him an apprentice,
but recalling him home: together with letters addressed,
one to the Pope’s Legate, Bishop Pietro
Donato, and the other to Antonio Casini, Cardinal
of San Marcello, asking leave for him to return:
the object being, that he should build the Loggia
di S. Paolo, (now the Casino dei Nobili). Among
the documents extracted by Signori Borghesi and
Banchi, we find several referring to work done by
Sano at Perugia: among other things, the construction
of a mill at Ragulano. We also learn
that, for the months of May and June, 1414, he
was Gonfaloniere of the Compagnia di Rialto e
Cartagne. He had two daughters: Caterina,
born on July 30th, 1405; and Mattia, who married
Gherardo di Niccolo.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<h3 class="lesser">7.  1398. <i>Luca di Cecco.</i></h3>

<p>A sculptor, whose signature is also found attached
to the document mentioned above. In 1375, and
again in 1377, his name occurs as witness to contracts
for works of art: the first, a picture for the
High Altar of the Duomo, to be made by Lorenzo
di Vanni and Nuccio di Neruccio: the second,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
a marble statue by Mariano d’Agnolo and Bartolommeo
di Tommè, for the Cappella del Campo.
In 1386, he was commissioned to make some
marble steps for the interior of the Duomo.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">8.  1405. <i>Cecco di Giovanni.</i></h3>

<p>Another unrecorded artist.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">9.  1406. <i>Marchesse d’ Adamo.</i></h3>

<p>Of this man, or of his stonemason companions
from Como, we hear nothing more than the short
notice I have given already. We know that
Comacene and Lombard workmen, especially
masons and sculptors, were labouring in great
numbers all over Italy at this period, and that
they have left their traces very markedly, throughout
all Tuscan and Umbrian Art. We know also,
that the stone workers of Siena made a compact
with those of Lombardy, residing and working in
that town, on the 5th of December, 1473, whereby
they gave to them certain privileges on payment of
suitable fees.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<h3 class="lesser">10.  1423–33. <i>Domenico di Niccolo del Coro.</i></h3>

<p>This great artist was born about 1363, and belonged
to the noble family of Spinelli. He was
one of the cleverest and most prolific workers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
his day. His principal trade was that of a wood-carver;
and he is said to have obtained his surname
of <i>del Coro</i> from his ability and success in designing
and carving Choir-stalls. From 1413 to 1423,
he held the post of Capo-maestro of the Opera del
Duomo of Siena, and we have records of work
done by him in glass, as well as in stone and wood.
He worked on the older Fonte Gaia, made designs
for an intended loggia (on the site of the present
Casino dei Nobili), to face into the Piazza del
Campo,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> and was sent for to Orvieto to advise
about the repair of the roof of the Duomo there.
The panels, inlaid with the <i>Symbols of the Creed</i>,
for the stalls of the Chapel of the Palazzo Pubblico,
executed by him between the years 1415–1428,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
after designs said to be by Taddeo Bartoli,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> are
works of exceptional beauty. After a long life, in
January 1446–7, we find him, at 84 years of age,
begging the Signoria of Siena to grant him a
pension. A sum of two florins a month was
allowed to him, but he could not have enjoyed it
for long, since after 1450 we entirely lose sight of

<h3 class="lesser">11.  1423. <i>Agostino di Niccolo.</i></h3>

<p>The only specimen of this artist’s work we know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
of in Siena, is that on the Pavement. We have
no other record of him except that in 1405, or
perhaps even earlier, he was working at Orvieto,
in company with a certain Nanni di Giacomo (a
cadet of the noble house of Castori, or Amidei), a
native of Lucca, but resident in Siena, and during
the next year, with an artist named Orbetano,
called <i>il Mastro</i>, also a Sienese.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">12.  1423. <i>Bastiano di Corso.</i></h3>

<p>Concerning this artist, we know that he came
from Florence, lived a long time in Siena, and
died rather before 1455. His family name was
Giuliani, and he married Francesca di Cristoforo
Pastella, by whom he had four sons: Taddeo;
Cristoforo (born 1422); Corso (of whom presently),
and Giuliano, who married, in 1469, Marianna,
daughter of Pietro Paoletti. Both of these were
sculptors, like their father. Milanesi gives many
notices of work in marble done by this artist, in
company with his sons, in the Cathedral, the
Baptistery, the Hospital of Sta. Maria della Scala,
and the Loggia di S. Paolo.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">13.  1426. <i>Paolo di Martino.</i></h3>

<p>Of this man, beyond the records of him in connexion
with the Pavement, scarcely anything is
known. He appears once, as witness to a contract
for some carved figures for the Duomo. A curious
fact occurs also, as to work done by him in the
before-mentioned Chapel of the Palazzo Pubblico.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111<a class="hidep" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
In 1414, he, his brother Antonio, and a certain
Simone d’Antonio, were commissioned to decorate
the stalls of that Chapel. Their work seems not
to have given public satisfaction, with the result
that the commission was taken away from them,
and given to Domenico del Coro, who, as we have
seen, executed his task triumphantly.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">14.  1434. <i>Domenico di Bartolo di Ghezzo da
Asciano.</i></h3>

<p>We find the name of this artist on the Roll of
Sienese Painters in 1428. Vasari would have us
believe, that he was the nephew of Taddeo Bartoli.
This, however, is proved to be erroneous, because
we know that Taddeo was the son of a barber,
one Bartolo di Maestro Mino: that his brother
died childless; and that his sister Petra married
a notary of Radicondoli, named Ser Antonio
Gennari. Domenico Bartoli was a member of the
well-known Ghezzi family of Asciano, and a
picture by him is still to be seen in the Church of
St. Agostino in his native town. He was born
about 1400, married in 1440<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Donna Antonia
Pannilini, and died in 1446.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> He was an artist of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113<a class="hidep" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
very great merit. His finest works are his frescoes
in the Pellegrinaggio of the Hospital of Sta.
Maria della Scala at Siena, which were painted in
1443–44.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> These frescoes throw a vivid light on
the manners, customs, costume, and style of architecture
of the period in which he lived, and form a
remarkable picture of Sienese life at that date. It
is, moreover, most interesting to note how much
the decorative effects, employed by him in his
work, foreshadow the coming Renaissance.</p>

<p>Appears to have been merely a workman (<i>manovale</i>),
as, except the record quoted, no other notice
appears of him among those hitherto extracted.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">16.  1447. <i>Pietro di Tommaso del Minella.</i></h3>

<p>A native of Siena, this famous sculptor and architect
was born on the 21st of December, 1391. He
was son of a certain Tommaso, surnamed <i>Minella</i>
and had two brothers, Antonio and Giovanni
(both workers in wood), the latter of whom became
a Franciscan monk, and Rector of the Hospital
of Sta. Croce. Pietro was a favourite pupil of
Giacomo della Quercia, who left him ten florins
in his will; and he worked with that great master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
on the famous Font in the Baptistery. From 1431
to 1433, he was Capo-maestro of the Opera del
Duomo at Orvieto, and with his brother Antonio,
executed some works there in intarsia on the stalls.
In 1437, Quercia gave him some commissions in
connection with the Loggia di S. Paolo, and in 1439
he was employed to make the choir for the Chapel
of the Hospital of Sta. Maria della Scala. Out of
this much litigation arose, which was settled by the
giving of a dowry to his daughter.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> In 1441, he and
his brother Antonio were commissioned to make a
new Bishops’ Throne for the Cathedral at Orvieto,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>
adorned with figures of SS. John and Costanzo;
but apparently, whether for want of funds or for
what reason does not appear, the work was never
completed.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> He remained at Orvieto until March,
1444, when he returned to Siena, where he had
been commissioned by the Council to execute
further work on the Loggia di S. Paolo.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> In
August of that year he was in treaty to go back
to Orvieto, and we find a document, showing that
he asked in payment for his services 120 ducats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
and a house, but agreed to accept 110 without the
house, arranging to come to Orvieto about the
middle of October to complete his bargain.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> In
September, however, he was promised by the
<i>Camarlingo</i> (perhaps the Treasurer) of the Opera
del Duomo at Siena, the post of Capo-maestro
there. This appointment, however, he did not
at first obtain, though he was employed on the
tomb of Carlo Bartoli, Bishop of Siena, for which
he received, as his share, a sum of 38 lire 8
soldi;<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and in the following year on the Chapel
of S. Crescenzio in the Duomo.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> At last, in 1447,
he was appointed Capo-maestro, and during his
occupation of the post, he designed the Church of
S. Ansano. He died in August, 1458, having
married Cristofora, daughter of Maestro Pannucci,
surnamed <i>Cinquino</i>, and had by her three sons—Tone
(Canon of the Duomo), Niccolo, and Sano,
who died in 1498, having married Polissena,
daughter of Arnoldo di Fortunato, by whom he
had six sons.</p>

<p>Of the first and second of these three men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
nothing is known but their names, and the notice
which records their work, described in the last
chapter. As I have suggested, Nastagio di Guasparre
and Guasparre d’ Agostino may have been
father and son, or master and pupil. I have also
referred to the fact that Guasparre d’Agostino
painted frescoes of the Crucifixion and Burial of
Christ in the apse over the altar of the Baptistery,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
and was commissioned to paint some scenes from
the life of S. Bernardino for the Sacristy of the
Duomo. We are told also by Milanesi<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> that he
was the master of Francesco di Giorgio and Neroccio
di Bartolommeo Landi.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">20.  1451. <i>Corso di Bastiano.</i></h3>

<p>Son of Bastiano di Corso, he married Nanna,
daughter of a certain Simone di Niccolo, surnamed
<i>Calabrese</i>, a maker of drinking vessels. He was,
as we have seen, a sculptor like his father, with
whom he worked. We read, besides, however,
that he made the balcony of the Palazzo Pubblico,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
whence the sentences on criminals were read, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>

<p>This sculptor and architect was one of the
glories of Siena in his time. In one document, to
be referred to later, he is called Tolomei (<i>de
Ptholomeis</i>), but we have no record as to his birth
or family. In 1444, he was among the artists
employed on the tomb of Bishop Carlo Bartoli,
and for his share in the work he received 15 lire.
In 1451, he was appointed Capo-maestro of the
Opera del Duomo at Orvieto,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> where he remained
until 1456, living in considerable style.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> He had
with him all the time his two pupils, Polimante of
Assisi and Vito di Marco, both of whom were
paid by the Duomo authorities. He was evidently
held in high honour, for we find on April 7th,
1452,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> the Signoria of Siena writing to the heads
of the Commune at Orvieto, to ask them to recommend
him to the notice of the Duke of Calabria.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
In April, 1453, with safe
conducts from the Republic of
Florence and the King of Naples,
he, with seven companions, went
to Carrara to quarry marble, and
in October of the same year he
started for Corneto for a similar
purpose; but was recalled
on the 5th of the same month,
to advise as to the roof of one
of the Chapels in the Duomo,
which threatened to collapse. In
September, 1456, he made, and
put into position, one of the
statues on the façade. During
this period he made statues of
SS. Ansano, Vittore, and Savino
for the Loggia di Mercanzia or
S. Paolo (now the Casino dei
Nobili), and executed the work
before the doors of the Baptistery,
to which we have already
alluded. (Ill. XXII.) After 1456,
he appears to have returned to
Siena, for we find a number
of references to a commission
for the statues of SS. Peter and
Paul, given first to Urbano da
Cortona, then to Federighi, and
lastly to Lorenzo di Pietro (<i>Il
Vecchietta</i>); the special object of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the last change being to keep that artist in Siena.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>
From 1460 to 1462, he was engaged in the design
and erection of the magnificent Loggia di Papa,
built by Pope Pius II.; and in 1463, on the palace
of that Pope’s sister, Caterina Piccolomini, called
then Palazzo <i>delle Papesse</i>, but now styled Palazzo
<i>Nerucci</i>.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> In 1469–70, we hear of work done by
him at the Oratorio di S. Caterina in Fontebranda;
in 1473 party to the contract
made between the Sienese and Lombard workers
in stone: and in 1480, he petitioned the authorities
with reference to the drainage and water-supply
of the town.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Other noticeable works by
him are the marble bench on the right-hand side
of the Loggia di Mercanzia, before-mentioned;
the basins of the two holy water stoups at the west
end of the Cathedral Nave (attributed, wrongly,
to Quercia); and the Chapel and Palace, outside
the Porta Camollia, known as the <i>Palazzo dei
Diavoli</i>.</p>

<h3 class="lesser noclear">22.  1473. <i>Urbano di Pietro di Domenico da
Cortona.</i></h3>

<p class="noclear">This artist came with his brother Bartolommeo,
in his early youth, from his native city of Cortona,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
to settle in Siena, where in 1451,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> they together
undertook to build the Chapel of the Madonna
delle Grazie, in the Duomo. In the same year he
was commissioned, as we have seen, to make two
statues for the Loggia di Mercanzia, but the commission
was cancelled. In 1456, he made a statue
of S. Bernardino for the Convent of the Osservanza,
and a figure of S. Peter for the façade of
the Duomo. In 1458, the Signoria of Siena deliberated
as to the suitability of employing him,
in company with Donatello, to procure alabaster
from the Val D’Orcia, to decorate a room in the
Palazzo Pubblico.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> Among the records of the
Oratorio di Sta. Caterina in Fontebranda, between
the years 1465 and 1474, we find two notices of
work by him: namely, a statue of the Saint over
the Chapel door, and a holy-water stoup. In
1471, he had a dispute with Bastiano di Francesco,
as to the price due for work done by the latter,
in which Vecchietta was one of the two arbitrators.
In the same year he was employed on
the Palazzo <i>delle Papesse</i>, and in 1473, we find him
also joining in the contract made by the Sienese
sculptors with their Lombard fellow-craftsmen.
In 1497–98, he was one of the arbitrators in a dispute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
between Giovanni di Stefano and his workmen.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>
He died in Siena, on May the 8th, 1504,
leaving, by his wife, Caterina Scotti, a daughter,
Lucrezia, who married Ser Pasquale Griffi, of
Montalcino; his son Tommaso having predeceased
him. His finest works still existing are
the decorations for the Chapel of the Madonna
delle Grazie referred to above, which are now
affixed to the walls of the Duomo, near the door
leading to the Campanile stairs; and the tomb of
Cav. Cristoforo Felice (Rector 1457–58 and 1460–65)
in the church of S. Francesco in Siena.</p>

<h3 class="lesser noclear">23.  1473. <i>Matteo di Giovanni di Bartolo.</i></h3>

<p class="noclear">This artist, also known as Matteo da Siena, was
born about 1435. It was erroneously supposed,
that he was the son of Giovanni di Paolo di
Grazia, the painter of Poggio Malavolti, and
brother of Pietro and Benvenuto di Giovanni,
also painters of repute. As a matter of fact,
however, Matteo’s father was a certain Giovanni
di Bartolo, a merchant of Borgo San Sepolcro,
who had settled in Siena, by his second wife,
Elisabetta, daughter of Andrea d’Ambrogio, a
goldsmith: while Pietro was the son of another
merchant, one Giovanni Pucci; and Benvenuto, of
a certain Giovanni di Maestro Meo del Guasta
of San Quirico. Moreover, Giovanni di Paolo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of Poggio was quite an old man when, in 1480,
he married a woman called Domenica, by whom
he had no children, as we find that by his will,
dated June 29th, 1482, he left her his sole heiress.</p>

<p>Matteo married twice; first, a certain Contessa,
by whom he had no children; and secondly,
Orsina di Francesco del Taia, by whom he had
three sons and four daughters. He died in June,
1495. He was a distinguished painter, much
admired in his day, and had a very distinct charm
of his own, in spite of his somewhat rigid adherence
to old traditions. Many of his pictures are still in
their original places in the churches of Siena,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> and
there are also some good specimens of his work
in the Accademia delle Belle Arti in that town.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">24.  1473. <i>Giovanni di Maestro Stefano di
Giovanni.</i></h3>

<p>Son of the celebrated painter, usually called
<i>Sassetta</i>. We first hear of him in 1452, as appealing
for judgment in the matter of the price of a
fresco, over the Porta Romana, left unfinished by
his father’s death; (subsequently completed by
Sano di Pietro, and Lorenzo di Pietro, commonly
called <i>Il Vecchietta</i>). In August 1446, he was
commissioned, with the assistance of the goldsmith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
Francesco d’Antonio, to make a silver head of
Sta. Caterina, for the Monks of S. Domenico in
Siena.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> He made a model for the head, which
Francesco executed in silver;<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> and perhaps the
tabernacle also, although that has been attributed
to Vecchietta. In 1466–68,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> we find a petition,
addressed to the Signoria, for the erection of two
stone wolves outside the Porta Nuova, or Romana.
These are generally supposed to have been the
work of this artist. In 1477, he was recommended
by the Signoria of Siena to Federigo, Duke of
Urbino; and in 1481, was witness to the commission,
given by the Opera del Duomo, to Urbano
di Pietro, Antonio Federighi, Vito di Marco and
Luigi di Ruggiero, to execute the Sibyls on the
Duomo Pavement; one of which (the <i>Cuman</i>) we
know was, in the following year, his work. In
1487, he executed the statue of S. Ansano (formerly
attributed to Neroccio di Bartolommeo Landi, of
whom presently) in the Chapel of S. Giovanni in
the Duomo.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> In 1427, in company with Giacomo
Cozzarelli, and Domenico di Matteo, he made a
valuation of the bronze doors, for the Libreria in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
the Duomo, executed by Giacomo Ormanni; and in
the same year we read of the dispute with his
workmen, to which we have alluded above. In
1497–98, he also executed two of the bronze
angels<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> for the High Altar of the Duomo. The
celebrated sculptor, Lorenzo di Mariano, better
known as <i>Il Marrina</i>, was one of his pupils.</p>

<p>Both these men appear to have been sculptors,
and are associated together, as arbitrators, with
Urbano da Cortona, in the dispute referred to
above, between Giovanni di Stefano and his workmen.
Of the former, we also find a record, under
date August 11th, 1507, as arbitrator between
Lorenzo di Mariano (<i>Il Marrina</i>) and Battista di
Simone,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> and we are told that he was surnamed
<i>Baccelli</i>, and died in 1531.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> Of Francesco we
know nothing more, except that he also signed
the contract with the Lombard sculptors.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">27.  1482. <i>Giuliano di Biagio.</i></h3>

<p>Of this artist, we know nothing, beyond the
reference to his work on the Pavement, of which
mention has been made above. He appears, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
to have been not merely the mason, but also
the contractor, who procured the marble for his
own work.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<h3 class="lesser">28.  1482. <i>Vito di Marco.</i></h3>

<p>A German, who, with his brother Giovanni,
came to settle in Siena, as a mason. He was, as
we have seen above, a pupil of Antonio Federighi,
and was employed under him, on the works at
Orvieto. In 1473, he was also party to the contract
between the Sienese and Lombard sculptors.
In 1483–84, he was commissioned, in company
with a certain Lucillo di Maestro Marco, to execute
the tomb of Tommaso del Testa Piccolomini,
Bishop of Pienza and Montalcino,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> which commission,
through his absence from Siena, and the
death of Lucillo, was transferred in the following
year to Neroccio di Bartolommeo Landi. In
1487, he executed the façade of the church of S.
Andrew at Orvieto, in which city we find him still
working in 1489–91. He died in 1495.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">29.  1482. <i>Luigi di Ruggiero, surnamed
L’Armellino.</i></h3>

<p>This man also joined in the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
contract with the Lombard stone workers (1473).
In January, 1486–87, we find the Signoria of Siena
writing to Ottaviano, Count of Mercatelli, on his
behalf, for arrears of salary due to him for work
done.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> He also appears to have been a contractor,
as well as a sculptor.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<h3 class="lesser">30.  1483. <i>Bastiano di Francesco di Sano.</i></h3>

<p>This man was a sculptor and a painter, but it is
uncertain whether he is the same person, as the
Florentine sculptor Bastiano di Francesco, who,
with Francesco di Giovanni, was employed to
build the tomb of Pope Pius III. in S. Peter’s at
Rome.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> We do not know much about him, beyond
the work which he did in the Duomo. In 1481,
he assisted Guidoccio Cozzarelli, Benvenuto di
Giovanni del Guasta, and Pellegrino di Mariano,
in decorating the interior of the Cupola with sculpture
and painting. We gather, that in 1484, he
moved the beautiful tomb of Cardinal Petroni, by
Tino di Camaino,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> from its original place near the
present Cappella del Voto, to its present lofty
position, by the Cappella di S. Giovanni. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
him, in the same and following years, are also due
the carved festoons, monstrous cherub heads, and
painting and gilding round the east window (<i>Occhio</i>)
of the choir. Twice we hear of him in legal difficulties:
once, as we have mentioned already, with
Urbano da Cortona in 1471; and again in 1477,
when a certain doctor of laws, one Prospero Poccio,
complained to the Podestà, that Bastiano would
not finish a picture for him, that he had contracted
to do.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> He appears to have lived in the Valle

<h3 class="lesser">31.  1483. <i>Benvenuto di Giovanni del Guasta.</i></h3>

<p>This versatile artist was the son, as we have
seen, of a certain Giovanni di Meo del Guasta, a
mason from San Quirico. He was born the 13th of
September, 1436, and died about 1518. He married
Jacopa, daughter of Tommaso da Cetona, by
whom he had three daughters, and a son, Girolamo,
also a clever artist. In 1466, we find him in company
with Sano di Pietro, valuing the decorative
work on two chests, made by a certain Francesco
d’Andrea, for Ambrogio Spannocchi. In 1481–82,
as we have already noted, he was employed on
the decoration of the interior of the Cupola in
the Duomo, where he painted thirty-five figures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129<a class="hidep" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
for which he received a sum of 105 lire.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> In the
same year, he painted miniatures in the Antiphonaries,
for the Duomo; one of which, the largest,
represented “<i>the Giving of the Keys to S. Peter</i>,”
for which he received 27 lire 14 soldi.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> That he was
much admired in his day as a painter, is evident
from the number of notices still to be found of payments
made to him for banners, bier-heads and
pictures of various sorts, by Convents and Guilds.
Many of these still exist, either in the Churches
for which they were painted, or in the Picture
Gallery.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> In 1508, he was called as witness, in a
lawsuit between Giovanni Battista di Bartolommeo
Alberti and the heirs of Neroccio Landi, as to
the price of an unfinished picture by that artist.
From the two inventories of his property, made
in 1491 and 1509, and the list of goods bequeathed
by him to his son Girolamo, we gather that he
lived in houses of his own: first, in the district of
Camollia; and latterly, in that of the Rialto in
Siena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<h3 class="lesser">32.  1483. <i>Neroccio di Bartolommeo di
Benedetto Landi.</i></h3>

<p>This great artist was equally celebrated, both
as sculptor and painter. He belonged to the
noble family of Landi, who are described as “<i>of
Poggio Malevolti</i>”, to distinguish them from the
family of Landi <i>Sberghieri</i>. He was born in 1447,
and died in 1500. He was twice married: first, to
Elisabetta, daughter of Antonio Cigalini, who died
in 1483; and, secondly, in 1493 to Lucrezia,
daughter of Antonio Paltoni, who bore him several
sons, one of whom was a painter as was his father.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>
Many of his pictures and statues still exist in
Siena, in the places for which he designed them.
In 1475, he appears to have quarrelled with Francesco
di Giorgio; a dispute that was settled by
the kindly offices of Sano di Pietro and Lorenzo
di Pietro (<i>Il Vecchietta</i>). In the following year
we find the same Sano di Pietro, with Francesco di
Giorgio, valuing a picture, painted by Neroccio,
for a certain Bernardino Nini. In the records of
the Oratorio di Sta. Caterina in Fontebranda,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> we
find that this artist was paid 31 lire, for a wooden
statue of the Saint, which still stands over the
altar in that Chapel. In 1481, he was engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
to work for the Duke of Calabria, and also for the
Abbot of the Benedictine Convent at Lucca. In
1484–85, he received the commission (originally
given to Vito di Marco and Lucillo, but cancelled
through the absence of the former, and the death of
the latter), to execute the tomb of Bishop Tommaso
del Testa Piccolomini.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> This tomb is now over the
door, leading from the Cathedral to the stairs of the
Campanile. In 1487, he was also directed to make
the beautiful statue of S. Catherine of Alexandria
for the Chapel of S. Giovanni in the Duomo; but
his death left the work unfinished. We find two
notices with reference to this work, dated 5th of
February, 1487–88, and 21st of August, 1502<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> respectively:
the first recording the payment of an
advance of 40 lire to the painter himself, and the
other of a further payment (in accordance with the
valuation of Giacomo Cozzarelli and Ventura di Ser
Giuliano) of 202 lire more to his heirs. These heirs,
as we have seen above, also had a lawsuit over
another unfinished work of his, with one of his
pupils, Giovanni Battista di Bartolommeo Alberti.
Milanesi quotes some interesting documents in connection
with this lawsuit in his notes.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> The names
of some of his pupils, besides the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>

<h3 class="lesser">33.  1483. <i>Guidoccio di Giovanni Cozzarelli.</i></h3>

<p>This artist must not be confused with the more
famous Giacomo di Bartolommeo di Marco Cozzarelli,
who was a sculptor and worker in metal, nor
do we know, whether or no, he was related in any
way to the engineer Giovanni Cozzarelli, a notice
of whose work on a bridge at Macereto, we find
under date 3rd of November, 1487.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> This man was
a painter of considerable ability, whose pictures
may be studied in the Picture Gallery, and who
executed some of the miniatures in the Duomo
Antiphonaries. We read that in 1447, he was
employed with Sano di Pietro, to decorate the
Chapel (now destroyed) of the Madonna delle
Grazie in the Cathedral; and that in 1481, he was
employed on the decoration of the interior of the
Cupola. Professor Luigi Mussini<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> suggests that
the Tavoletta di Biccherna (No. 34 of those preserved
in the Archivio di Stato), representing <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>

<h3 class="lesser">36.  1505–6. <i>Bernardino di Benedetto or Betto</i>
(<i>Il Pinturicchio</i>).</h3>

<p>Of this painter, and his work, so much has been
written elsewhere, that I shall only attempt the
briefest sketch of his life here.</p>

<p>He was a native of Perugia, was the son of a
certain Betto or Benedetto, and was born in 1454.
He had six children by his wife Grania: Adriana,
who married Giuseppe, son of Giovanni of Perugia,
and died in 1518: Clelia or Egidia, who married
Girolamo, son of Paolo of Perugia, called <i>Paffa</i>, a
soldier of the guard of Siena; Giulio Cesare (b.
1506); Camillo (b. 1509); Faustina Girolama (b.
1510); and Faustina, who married Filippo, son of
Paolo of Perugia, or of Deruta. His frescoes in
the Libreria of the Duomo, and the chapel of S.
Giovanni, are among the most celebrated of Italian
works of art. Vasari relates many more or less
fictitious stories about his life and doings, which,
though amusing to read, are not borne out by fact.
He died in 1513, and was buried in the Church of
SS. Vincenzo and Anastasia, the Chapel of the
<i>Contrada of the Porcupine</i> (<i>Istrice</i>).</p>

<h3 class="lesser">38.  1518. <i>Domenico di Jacopo di Pace Beccafumi,
called Mecarino</i> (<i>or Mecherino</i>).</h3>

<p>This very celebrated painter and sculptor was
the son of a certain Giacomo (Jacopo) di Pace,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> a
labourer on the Podere of Cortine, near the Castle
of Montaperto, and was born in 1486. This Podere
was the property of the Sienese noble, Lorenzo
Beccafumi, who, more than once held high offices
in his native town. The boy early showed remarkable
artistic promise, and used to amuse himself
modelling animals, flowers, and leaves in clay.
Lorenzo Beccafumi, one day seeing these efforts,
and being struck by their promise, took him into his
house, as a sort of servitor, but also gave him the
opportunity of studying art. Near the house of
the Beccafumi family, was then living an artist,
named <i>Mecarino</i>, of poor ability and circumstances,
but possessing a fine collection of drawings
by good masters. These the young Domenico
studied carefully, and on the death of Mecarino,
by that artist’s special wish, assumed his name.
In later years, he also added, by permission of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
first patron, the name of <i>Beccafumi</i>. He was
married twice. By his first wife, Andreoccia, of
whose family and origin nothing is known, he had
a son, Adriano, who died poor and childless in
1588. By his second wife, Caterina, sister of
Pietro Cataneo, the Sienese architect and mathematician,
he had two daughters: Ersilia (b. 1535),
and Polifila (b. 1573), who became afterwards a
Gesuate nun, under the name of Suor Cecilia.
His work was very much sought after, and is to be
found in all directions, in churches and palaces alike,
throughout Siena. (Ill. XXV.) At one time, he
came very much under the influence of Giovanni
Antonio Bazzi (called <i>Il Sodoma</i>), in whose company
he worked, from 1518 to 1532, at the decoration
of the Oratorio di S. Bernardino,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> but subsequently,
became his rival and bitter enemy.
One of his earliest works in Siena was, in 1513,
the decoration in fresco of the façade of the
Palazzo de’ Borghesi in the Piazza di Postierla,
opposite the house of Agostino Bardi, soon afterwards
adorned in similar materials by Sodoma.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> In
February, 1515, he purchased a house, numbered
408, in the Via dei Maestri (now Via Tito Sarocchi),
for which he paid 270 florins, and, in 1545, another
house next door for 245 florins.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> We find him
continually in request to value works of art of all
kinds: panel-pictures, frescoes, bronze crucifixes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137<a class="hidep" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
marble tombs, etc., and Guilds were always employing
him to paint bier-heads and banners for
them. Among the latter, we are told that he was
engaged by the Compagnia di S. Sebastiano in
Camollia, to complete Sodoma’s celebrated banner
of S. Sebastian (now in the Uffizi Gallery in
Florence).<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> In 1529, and again in 1535, he received
commissions to decorate the Sala del Concistoro
in the Palazzo Pubblico; and on the occasion
of the visit of Charles V. to Siena (23rd of
April, 1536), he, in company with Anton Maria di
Paolo Lari (nicknamed <i>Il Tozzo</i>) and Lorenzo
Donati, designed and erected a triumphal arch
and other decorations, including a gigantic horse
in papier-mâché, in honour of that Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> He
was also famous as a worker in bronze,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> and among
the works done by him in this metal, the most
celebrated, now known, are six of the bronze angels,
holding lights, affixed to the columns in the Choir
of the Duomo. For this work he received 11,600
lire from the Opera del Duomo. According to a
contemporary Register of persons buried in the
Duomo, Beccafumi died on the 18th May, 1550,
and was buried there: other authorities state that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139<a class="hidep" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
his death occurred in the following year.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> Giorgio
di Gio. Simone was one of his pupils, and Giovanni
Battista di Girolamo Sozzini (of whom presently)
was another.</p>

<p>This painter and sculptor was born in Siena in
1525, and studied the arts of drawing and painting
under Bartolommeo Neroni (<i>Il Riccio</i>). He was
also a pupil of Beccafumi’s, and in addition learned
to make portrait-effigies in stucco and wax under
Pastorino Pastorini, in which art he excelled.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> He
was brother to the celebrated Alessandro Sozzini,

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> far as I have been able to ascertain, there
are but three other examples of Pavement
work, similar to that employed in the Siena Duomo.
Mosaic pavements, of course, abound all over Italy,
with more or less elaborate designs, fanciful, historical,
or symbolical;<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> but none of them really resembles
this kind of work, which seems to have
been peculiar to the artistic mind of the Sienese.
The only other works, that I can find, that can, in
any degree, be allied to it are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The Cathedral Pavement at Lucca.</p>

<p>2. The Pavement of the Piccolomini Chapel at
S. Francesco, in Siena.</p>

<p>3. The Pavement of the Chapel of Sta. Caterina
in S. Domenico, in the same town.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us take them in order of date.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">1. <i>The Cathedral Pavement at Lucca.</i></h3>

<p>This floor is covered with geometrical patterns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
in inlay, and was executed during the Rectorship
of Jacopo di Chivizzano (1470–1484). We know,
from several references in the Archives of the
“Opera” of that Cathedral, that it had been commenced
before 1475,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> and that, among others,
Matteo Civitali, the great Lucchese sculptor, was
employed upon some of the designs on it. It
principally consists of merely ornamental friezes
and geometrical designs. In the centre of the
Nave, however, there is one picture, to which I
would draw special attention. It represents the
<i>Judgment of Solomon</i>, and is the work of one
Antonio di Ghino of Siena. It was commissioned,
we read,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> by a certain Bartolommeo Guarguaglia,
and finished in 1477.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> The work is of the same kind
as that at Siena, but is coarser and heavier in type.
In design it most resembles the work of Domenico
di Bartolo, but there are suggestions in some of
the female figures of the influence,—Botticellesque
perhaps,—that produced Matteo di Giovanni’s
<i>Judith</i> and her maid, in the <i>Relief of Bethulia</i>.
Solomon sits on a throne, under a sort of pillared
loggia, surrounded by courtiers and attendants,
while before him stand the claimants and their
infants. The colouring of the picture, the somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
brutal force of the composition, and the plentiful use
of vari-coloured marbles, recall Matteo di Giovanni’s
<i>Massacre of the Innocents</i>, although that work was
not executed until several years later. Being in
the centre of the nave, and not covered, it has
been much injured by time and hard usage. Of
its maker, Antonio di Ghino, we know but little.
From a note given by Milanesi,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> we gather that,
though here called “<i>da Siena</i>,” he really came of
Lucchese stock, and was the son of one Ghino di
Paolo of Lucca, a sculptor who lived long in Siena,
and died in 1482. Antonio apparently had a son,
who signed the Painters’ Brief in 1533.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">2. <i>The Pavement of the Cappella Piccolominea in
S. Francesco.</i></h3>

<p>This chapel, which was originally dedicated to
S. Andrew, has recently been entirely rejuvenated,
at the expense of the late Signora Anna Camaiori
Saracini, and re-dedicated to Sta. Anna. There is
not, therefore, at first sight much trace of the
original work left. We know that, in 1504,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> Lorenzo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
di Mariano (<i>Il Marrina</i>) was employed by Giacomo
Piccolomini, brother of Pope Pius III., to adorn
their family chapel in this church; and, that he not
only made an altar, the decorations around the
windows, and the entrance arch to the chapel, but
also laid down four Cardinal Virtues: <i>Justice</i>,
<i>Prudence</i>, <i>Fortitude</i>, and <i>Temperance</i>, on the floor.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>
Of all this work, the various conflagrations, that have
destroyed the great church of S. Francesco, have
left only the arch, the coats of arms, the windows,
a small portion of the altar, and the pavement.
Restoration, of a too complete kind, has even further
concealed the original nature of what remained;
and one’s first impression on looking at this pavement
is that it is brand-new, so well has Professor
Leopoldo Maccari done his work.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> The figures,
however, on close inspection, show high merit.
They are finely conceived, on the lines of the
Sibyls in the Duomo, and are imposing pieces of
work. Lorenzo di Mariano (<i>Il Marrina</i>) was one
of the finest sculptors of his time. He was born on
the 11th of August, 1476, and was the son of
Mariano di Domenico Nanni, a goldsmith. In
1506, he became Capo-maestro of the Opera del
Duomo,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> where he had been employed since 1490,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
under the mastership of Giovanni di Maestro
Stefano. On the 28th of January, in the following
year, he married Elisabetta, daughter of Ser Jacopo
Bertini, by whom he had four sons: by name,
Girolamo, Gio.-Battista, Agostino, and Giacomo,
who were goldsmiths; and one daughter, Bartolommea,
who married Lattanzio di Gio. Lotti. He
worked a great deal for the various members of
the Piccolomini family; the finest extant piece
commissioned by them remaining, being the doorway
of the Libreria in the Duomo. A tabernacle
in the chapel of the Convent of S. Girolamo, and,
above all, the exquisite altar in the church of the
Fontegiusta by him, testify that the admiration, in
which he was held, in his day, was not misplaced.</p>

<h3 class="lesser">3. <i>The Pavement of the Chapel of Sta. Caterina
in S. Domenico.</i></h3>

<p>Of this work we have no reliable record; but it
is clearly of late date, perhaps made in the sixteenth
century, and most probably, as a sepulchral
memorial. We learn from Abate Faluschi,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> that
this chapel belonged to the Benzi family, and was
their burial-place. Hither was brought the body
of the famous Marco, son of Giovanni Benzi and
Nicola Serfucci, who was physician to Niccolo,
Marchese d’Este, and died in Ferrara in 1429.
The corpse was buried by his uncle Ugo, son of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
Andrea Benzi and Minoccia Pagni, in 1448; and
the chapel was built over the grave by Niccolo
Buonsignore Benzi in 1488. The following inscription,
now <span class="locked">effaced:—</span></p>

<p class="in0">was placed to the memory of Marco Benzi. We
find too, that another physician, Sozzini Benzi,
belonging to the same family, was also buried
here. The decoration of this chapel, by Sodoma,
did not take place until 1526; and it is not improbable,
that the floor was subsequent to that
date. So that it may have been the work of the
last of the Pavement Masters, Giovanni Battista
Sozzini, spoken of above. The Sozzinis were a
distinguished family, and if the name tells us anything,
may have been related to this very Sozzini
Benzi. The figure of Æsculapius, seated among
various wild beasts, would then have appropriate
reference to the merits of these two physicians.
It is strange to find such a classical piece of composition
in a chapel dedicated to Sta. Caterina di
Siena, a saint so pre-eminently ecclesiastical; but
it is quite in accordance with the spirit of the
time. Æsculapius, a handsome nude youth, resembling
Orpheus or Bacchus, is seated on a rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
in a grove of oaks, laurels, and fruit-trees. In his
right hand he holds a mirror in which is reflected
his own face. To his right, are an unicorn and a
wolf: to his left, a leopard and a lion. Perched
on the trees, in various directions, are sundry
birds: owls, vultures, eagles, etc. One vulture,
on the right of the principal figure, is screaming
at a monkey, who is eating fruit. On the other
side, another bird is clawing at an over-grown
squirrel. Around the composition is a frieze representing
water, on which are swimming swans
and ducks.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> The composition is good, but the
perspective is odd, and the use of many coloured
marbles profuse, and not altogether happy.</p>

<span class="subhead">MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP OF THE PAVEMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Most</span> of the writers on the Pavement, speak
of its workmanship, as being of four kinds.
This would give the idea of four distinct methods,
abruptly divided, which is most certainly not the
case. The line of division is so indistinct, and
the various styles so blended one into the other,
that I can only describe it as an <i>evolution</i>, during
which four special changes took place.</p>

<p>The earliest and simplest method consisted in
using large pieces of white marble, shaped and
put together (“<i>commesso</i>”) to form a sort of silhouette:
the perspectives, folds of robes, and other
details being defined by lines made, first, with a
graving tool, and then accentuated by rows of
holes, (smaller or larger, according to the importance
of the particular line in the general composition),
pierced with a trepanning drill. This is
said to be <i>a trapano</i>, and is in fact the real
<i>graffito</i> work. These punctures were frequently
very deep, and when filled up with a stucco, composed
of pitch (<i>pecie navale</i>), resin (<i>ragia</i>), and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
pounded potter’s clay (<i>bolio macinato</i>), produced
a surface hard, and nearly as durable, as the solid
marble itself. In order further to heighten the
effect, the pieces of white marble, making up the
entire scene or figure, were inlaid against a piece
of dark marble: generally black for the atmosphere,
and red for the ground, upon which the
figures were supposed to stand. In the ornamental
friezes, framing these scenes and figures, marble of
other colours very early began to be used. Then
presently, these coloured marbles found their way
into the picture itself; especially in the larger
scenes, where yellow, for instance, was found useful
to accentuate jewellery or ornaments. Take
as an example, <i>The Massacre of the Innocents</i>
(Matteo di Giovanni), in which it is very largely
employed. To this end also, black marble is twice
introduced with startling effect: for <i>The Libyan
Sibyl</i> (Guidoccio Cozzarelli), and for the negro
boy in <i>The Story of Jephthah</i> (Bastiano di Francesco).
It is undoubtedly true, that the finest
effects are obtained, where there is least variety
in colour, and where the artist has depended most
entirely on simple line, and contrasts of white
marble against black. A fine specimen of this
treatment is <i>The Story of Absalom</i> (Pietro del
Minella). Here the figures, trees, etc., stand
out with almost weird abruptness, as if they had
been cut out of white paper. It must be borne in
mind, however, (in spite of statements made to the
contrary, and the fact that such methods were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
employed elsewhere later on),<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> that the marbles
used on the Pavement were always <i>natural</i>, and
<i>not artificially coloured</i>. The Duomo authorities
appear to have had quarries, either of their own,
or under contract to supply them regularly. We
read of <i>nostro marmiera</i><a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> at Gallena, in the Val
d’Elsa; of black marble, brought from <i>chasciano
de le donne</i> (San Casciano, near Radicofani);<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> and
of red from Gerfalco in the Val di Cecina, near
Massa Marittima.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>Pinturicchio, following out his ardent taste for
brilliant and bizarre effect, made plentiful use of
these colour varieties; but what probably makes the
work of Beccafumi so striking, as compared with
that of his predecessors, is, that in his later work
he discards these vivid contrasts, confines himself
almost entirely to low tones of colour, which shade
from one into the other; and produces his effects
by a species of <i>chiaroscuro</i>. Instead of outlining
each piece, or figure, in a single colour, he frequently
uses on the same subject, white and two
or three different shades of pale-coloured grey
marble. On a face, or a nude figure, this gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
the effect of shadows of varying intensity, but, at
times, runs perilously near the ludicrous, by making
some of the persons parti-coloured. In the Elijah
series,—his earliest work,—probably with an idea
of improving on his predecessors, he had introduced
small pieces of vivid green and red marble,
to indicate jewelled borders to the robes of Ahab,
and other important personages. This treatment,
adopted again by Professor Franchi, when completing
that Story, he soon wholly discarded, still
retaining, however, the old <i>graffito</i> method for his
outlines. But this also he abandoned more and
more as he proceeded. Had he not been so fine
a draughtsman his experiments in this direction
would have been dangerous. Even now, it is
doubtful, whether the results are so practically
durable, or so artistically satisfactory, on the floor,
as the older work. It would seem, as if they, in
a sense, the apotheosis of this species of work,
should be set up perpendicularly, so that the full
effect of their superb draughtsmanship could be
fairly perceived and appreciated.</p>

<p>Professor Franchi must have found himself in
a great dilemma, when he undertook to complete
this work. He could hardly revert to the manner
of the pre-Beccafumi schools, and it would have
been too dangerous to imitate closely Beccafumi
himself. Fortunately, he had special gifts, and
had the courage to follow his own instinct. The
result has been, works, which, if in vivid contrast
to all that had gone before, and essentially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
modern in feeling, are works of art of unquestionable
brilliance. They resemble cartoons in marble,
and are drawn with extraordinarily realistic force.
All the three larger designs are instinct with life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
and irresistibly suggestive of energetic movement.
We may especially notice for this <i>Elijah being
caught up to Heaven</i>. (Ill. XXVI.)</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me say, that whatever may
be the opinion of critics of undoubted ability: first,
as to the suitability of a Pavement, such as this,
at all;<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> and next, as to the varying merits of this
or that portion of it, over any other: there can be
no doubt, as to its paramount and unique interest,
historically, as well as artistically. It is in itself a
small epitome of Sienese Art History: a continuous
chain, whose links bind together, in spite of long
intervals, more than five centuries of Sienese art-workers;
and a never-ending joy to the thoughtful
and the intelligent.</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Spelling was not checked systematically for any
language, including English and Italian. Transcriber
did change the spelling of a few names to make them
consistent with their predominant spelling elsewhere
in the original book, and corrected the Greek
spelling in <a href="#Footnote_23">Footnote 23</a> (originally on page <a href="#Page_22">22</a>).</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious; most were left unbalanced.</p>

<p>Illustrations in this eBook have been positioned
between paragraphs and outside quotations. In versions
of this eBook that support hyperlinks, the page
references in the List of Illustrations lead to the
corresponding illustrations.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages, have
been collected, renumbered into one sequence, and
placed just before the Index.</p>

<p>The index was not checked for proper alphabetization
or correct page references.</p>

<p>The table starting on <a href="#Page_xiv">page xiv</a>
originally had only vertical lines separating the columns,
and (the Transcriber believes) some of the long descriptions
overlapped the following entries to save paper. In the
HTML version of this eBook, Transcriber has added horizontal
separator lines to improve readability, and has ensured the
long descriptions do not overlap other entries. (Some
eReaders may not display the separator lines.) Also, dates
and corresponding numbers (columns 3 and 4) are vertically
centered in the HTML version of this eBook, although they
originally were placed along the bottom rows of the
descriptions.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_56">56</a>: In “B^{a..}”, the “a” was printed as a small
superscript with two dots below it.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_136">136</a>: “he had two daughters: Ersilia (b. 1535),
and Polifila (b. 1573)” was printed that way, but
one of the dates likely was misprinted.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
